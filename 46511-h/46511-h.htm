<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Countless centuries have come and gone and have left on the earth
myriad forms of life; but just what life is, from whence it came,
whether or not there is purpose or design behind it, whether or not
all the sacred books are mere conceptions of the infant mind, of the
whence and whither, we do not know; but when we put life beneath the
searchlight of science, we do know that it is a mere assembling of
ionic matter into organic forms, and that this strange work is done in
accordance with certain well-defined laws.</p>

<p>We know that these laws are a part of the great cosmic scheme. In
harmony with them works evolution, which tends to lift to higher and
higher degrees of perfection all forms of both animate and inanimate
life. We believe that if all the natural laws governing life could be
ascertained and obeyed, the number of disorders or interferences with
Nature's scheme would be very greatly decreased.</p>

<p>Man's system of co-operating with his fellow-creatures, which
we call civilization, has imposed certain restrictions, duties and
limitations upon him, which make it impossible for him to live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
strict accordance with these laws; therefore if
he would have his birthright, which is health, he must employ science
to fit him into his artificial environment.</p>

<p>Man has been brought to his present state of physical development
on the rural, outdoor, close-to-nature plan, and since he must live in
houses and pursue occupations foreign to those through which he was
developed, he must make corresponding changes in the material from
which his body is constantly being repaired and made; therefore, as
the selections, combinations, and proportions of the various things he
needs for nourishment are determined by his age, activity, and exposure
to the open air, if he accurately or even approximately ascertains and
observes these things, life will continually ascend in the scale of
power and grandeur, and his endurance and period of longevity will be
increased.</p>

<p>Nearly all forms of life on this globe, except man, live
approximately eight times their period of maturity. Man matures at
twenty-four; measured by this scale he should live about two hundred
years. But the average life of civilized man, reckoning from the age of
six, is only about forty years, while if we include the infant class,
and reckon the average age from his birth, he scarcely gets his growth
before his hair and teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
are disappearing, and his eyesight is being propped up by the lens of
the oculist, and he quietly drops into his grave. One hundred and sixty
years of life, then, is about what civilization has cost him up to
date. This is very expensive, but of course he has something to show
for it. He has aeroplanes, wireless communication, the mile-a-minute
train, politics, several kinds of religion, rum and cocain, the tramp,
the billionaire, and the bread line.</p>

<p>We cannot consistently leap over ten thousand years of heredity
and habit, but we can recover some part of the one hundred and
sixty years of life civilization has cost us. This can be done by
feeding our bodies according to their requirements determined by age,
temperature of environment, and work or activity; by cultivating mental
tranquillity; by loving some one besides ourselves, and proving it; by
breathing an abundance of fresh air, and by doing useful work. Of all
these things food is the most important because it is the raw material
that builds the temple wherein all other things dwell.</p>

<p>Civilization and science are doing but little real good for man if
they cannot select for him the material necessary to develop his body
and all its faculties to their highest degree, or at least free him
from much of his disease and materially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
increase his "ease"; they have brought him but little, I say, if they
cannot show him a way to live more than forty years. Science would have
nothing of which to boast if it only pointed out a way by which man
could exist for two hundred years, as this is his birthright. It can
only boast when it has given him more than his natural heritage.</p>

<p>That man's general health and period of longevity have decreased,
while all other branches of science have so vastly increased, is
evidence sufficient to justify the assertion that he has not employed
scientific methods to the art of living, or at least to those
fundamental principles, such as nutrition, motion, and oxidation, which
really govern his health and his life.</p>

<p>The difference between youth and age, between virility and senility,
is in reality a chemical difference only. The difference between the
flexible cartilage of youth, and the stiff cartilage of age is one of
chemistry.</p>

<p>If, by the process of metabolism, the muscles, bones, tissues, and
brain-cells can be made to multiply and to reproduce themselves at
eighteen, it seems only logical that science should give us the secret
by which this same thing could be done at eighty, and if at eighty, why
not at a hundred and eighty? It is by no means extravagant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
say that if science can teach us the actual demands of the body under
the varied conditions of age, climate, and activity, and the means of
supplying these demands with only such food elements as are needed,
life can be prolonged to what seems to be our natural period of
years.</p>

<p>Consider the human body as a machine that possesses the power of
converting fuel or food into energy, using or expending that energy
at will, reproducing itself piece by piece from the same fuel, and
casting out the debris and ashes&mdash;if all this is done by the body
automatically, and its power to act or to do these things depends so
completely upon the fuel or the material with which the body has to
work, then the question of the <em>kind</em> of fuel, the quantity, how
to select it, how to combine it, how to proportion it, becomes at once
the most important problem within the scope of human learning.</p>


<p class="p2">THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK</p>

<p>When we compare man's longevity with other forms of life, and
consider that he breathes the same air, drinks the same water, lives
under the same sunshine, and that he differs from them chiefly in his
habits of eating, the conviction is forced upon us that in his food is
found the secret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
or the causes of most of his physical ills and his shortened life. All
elements composing the human body are well known. Its daily needs are
matters of common knowledge. Science has separated the human body into
all its various chemical elements or parts, and weighed and named them;
it has also analyzed and separated his food or fuel into its various
chemical elements or parts, and named these. It would seem, therefore,
a most logical step to unite these two branches of science, and to give
to the world the dual science of Physio-food Chemistry, or, what I have
named Applied Food Chemistry.</p>

<p>The sciences of physiological chemistry and of food chemistry
can be made useful only by uniting them&mdash;putting them
together&mdash;fitting one into the other for the betterment of the
human species. These two branches of science can be of use in no other
possible way except by ascertaining the demands of the human body
through physiological chemistry, and by learning how to supply these
demands through the science of food chemistry. In the union of these
hitherto separate branches of science I can see the most useful, the
most important, and the most powerful department of human knowledge. It
is this union that these volumes are designed to make.</p>

<p>The human body is composed of fifteen
well-defined chemical elements. A normal

these elements in about the following

<p>There are a number of other body-elements, but they are so remote
that they have not been clearly defined by physiological chemists.
All these body-elements are nourished separately, or, as it were,
individually. They must be replenished in the body as rapidly as they
are consumed by the vital processes, and this can be accomplished only
through the action of the elements, in the forms of food, air, and
water, received into the body and assimilated by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where 91 per cent of human ills originate</div>

<p>From my professional experience I have estimated that about 91
per cent of all human ills have their origin in the stomach and the
intestines, and are caused directly by incorrect habits in eating
and drinking. If this is true, or even approximately true, it shows
that, in its relation to health and the pursuit of happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
food is the most important matter with which we have to deal; yet the
average person devotes far less consideration to it than he does to the
gossip of the neighborhood, or to the accumulating of a few surplus
dollars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eminent writers agree as to importance of
diet</div>

<p>Profs. Pavloff, Metchnikoff and Chittenden; Hon. R. Russell; Drs.
Rabagliati, and Wiley, Ex-Chief of our Federal Bureau of Chemistry,
and many other profound thinkers and writers have given in their
various books an array of facts which prove beyond doubt that food
is the controlling factor in life, strength, and health; yet they
have given us but few practical suggestions as to how it should be
selected, combined, and proportioned, so as to produce normal health,
and especially how to make it remedial and curative, or to make it
counteract the appalling increase in disease.</p>

<p>I have endeavored to begin where the great theorists left
off&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 By becoming familiar with the
chemistry of food</p>

<p>2 By becoming familiar with the chemistry of the
body</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Food chemistry useless without body
chemistry</div>

<p>Until my work began these two great sciences had been taught
as distinct and separate branches of learning, while in reality
<em>physiological chemistry</em> is but half of a science, and <em>food
chemistry</em> is, in fact, the other half of the same science.
The energy in food cannot be developed without the body&mdash;the
body cannot develop energy without food. Each branch is worthless,
therefore, without the other. In this work I have endeavored to unite
them and to make of the two one practical, provable, and usable
science.</p>


<p class="p2">RELATION OF SUPERACIDITY TO OTHER
DISEASES</p>

<p>Nearly all stomach and intestinal troubles begin with superacidity.
This is caused by the wrong combinations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> food, or
overeating. Food passing from the stomach, thus supercharged with
<span class="sidenote">Superacidity a primary cause</span>
acid, causes irritation of the mucous lining of the alimentary
tract. This results in nervousness, insomnia, intestinal congestion
(constipation), fermentation, and intestinal gas, while the excess
of acid in the stomach causes irritation of the mucous surface of
that much-abused organ, which develops first into catarrh, then
ulceration, and sometimes into cancer. The accumulation of gas from
the fermenting mass in the intestines causes irregular heart action,
and sometimes heart failure. The great number of sudden deaths from
this cause is pronounced by physicians "heart failure." In this the
doctors and the writer agree&mdash;I know of no other way to die except
for the heart to fail. The primary purpose of this work, however,
is to ascertain <em>why</em> the heart fails, and, if possible, to
remove the causes. From the fermenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> food toxic (poisonous)
substances, such as carbon dioxid, are generated, which, when taken
into the circulation, become a most prolific source of autointoxication
(self-poisoning).</p>

<p>From long experience gained by scientific feeding, in treating
stomach and intestinal trouble, it became apparent that a great many
disorders, very remote from the stomach, completely disappear when
perfect digestion and assimilation of food, and thorough elimination
of waste are effected. This has led to a very searching investigation
of causes, and to the preparation of the following chart, which is
designed to show how a great many so-called diseases can be traced back
to one original cause&mdash;superacidity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/illus-page8large.jpg"><img src="images/illus-page8.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>CHART, SHOWING THE NUMBER OF SO CALLED<br />
DISEASES CAUSED BY SUPERACIDITY</p>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Power to resist disease depends upon correct
feeding</div>

<p>Aside from emotional storms, great nervous shocks, inoculation
(vaccination), and violent exposure, nearly all diseases can be
traced back to the stomach, or errors in eating. Even in cases of
exposure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> vaccination, or
contagion, if the digestion and the assimilation of food, and the
elimination of waste are perfect, the body will have the power to
resist nearly all these causes of disease. Curing disease, therefore,
by scientific feeding, is merely a method of removing causes and
<em>giving Nature a chance</em> to restore normality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foods that ferment make inferior flesh</div>

<p>Food that sours, ferments, or that does not digest within Nature's
time-limit, cannot make good bone and brain. A defective digestion that
converts food into poisonous gases in the intestinal canal will make
inferior flesh and blood, just as any other defective machine will
turn out inferior work. This is the natural law governing all animal
life.</p>

<p>Millions of learned people admit that good specimens of men and
women can be constructed only out of good building material. They admit
that the quality of a man, like that of a house, or a machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
depends upon the kind of material used in his construction; and yet
<span class="sidenote">Nature's protest against unsuitable building material</span>
they allow this important material to be selected and prepared by the
most ignorant and unlearned, and they take it into their bodies with
a childish thoughtlessness that is amazing; and when Nature imposes
her penalty for violating her laws, they seek a remedy in drugs and
medicines, and these are applied only to the symptoms which are merely
the protest Nature is uttering. Thus a powerful drug silences or kills
the friendly messenger who brought the timely warning, but the cause
still remains. Suppose houses, ships, and machinery were constructed
and repaired after this plan!</p>


<p class="p2">NATURAL LAWS DEMAND OBEDIENCE</p>

<p>Recompense for obedience to natural law, and punishment for its
violation, are the invariable order of the universe, and are nowhere so
effectively and emphatically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> demonstrated as in the cause and cure
of the condition called disease.</p>

<p>There are certain laws which, if obeyed, will build the human body
to its highest efficiency of energy, vitality and strength; but in
order to obey these laws, one must know them, and in order to know them
one must pass through the long and arduous mill of experience, or else
learn from one who has done so.</p>

<p>Pain is a warning that something is wrong with the human mechanism,
and he who tries to silence this signal with medicine will be punished
for two wrongs instead of one. Nature tolerates no trifling, no
deception; her laws are inexorable, her penalties inevitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treating symptoms instead of causes</div>

<p>Multitudes of people are convinced that there is <em>something
wrong</em> with their eating. Instead of food giving them the highest
degree of mental and physical strength, which it should do, it actually
produces ills and bodily disorders; moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> not knowing the
cause, people have no conception of a remedy other than drugs. It is
amazing when one thinks how man, for two thousand years, has treated
disease. Instead of studying causes and endeavoring to remove them,
he has treated symptoms and symptoms only. It is generally known that
the practise of medicine consists in treating symptoms rather than
causes. For example, nearly all headaches&mdash;one of our common
afflictions&mdash;are caused indirectly by impaired digestion, faulty
secretion and excretion, yet the drug stores and Materia Medica (the
Bible of the profession), are laden with "headache cures," all of
which act only upon the symptoms. The whole system of drugging people
when they are sick is merely a method of quieting the signals&mdash;of
killing or paralyzing the messengers. Most drugs, taken into the
human body, are merely diminutive explosives, the effect of which
is destructive. They are like a lash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> cruelly applied to a
willing servant who lags from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Ease" and "Dis-ease"</div>

<p>Since symptoms are really the language of Nature, if we learn to
interpret them, we need never err in diagnosis, and consequently
never err in getting directly at the causes, as we must do in order
to "cure." A drug that could <em>cure</em> a disorder caused by wrong
feeding would perform a miracle. <em>It would reverse one of the fixed
laws of the universe. It would produce an effect without a cause.</em>
Nature works along the lines of least resistance, and points out with
unerring certainty the best, the cheapest, and the easiest way to live.
Health was originally called "ease." People who did not have health
were in disgrace or "dis-eased."</p>


<p class="p2">HOW TO MAKE HUMAN NUTRITION A SCIENCE</p>

<p>Human nutrition cannot be made a science under the conventional
methods of omnivorous eating&mdash;eating anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and everything without thought or reason. Nutrition can only be made
a science by limiting the articles of food to such things as will
reproduce all the chemical elements of the human body, mentioned at the
beginning of this lesson.</p>

<p>The further we remove foods from their natural state, the more
difficult becomes their analysis, their reliability, and a knowledge
of their chemistry, therefore the menus that appear in this work
include only the foods that will give to the body the best elements of
nutrition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prepared foods unscientific</div>

<p>There is but little difficulty in ascertaining the chemistry of
natural foods, but when they have been preserved, pickled, canned,
smoked, evaporated, milled, roasted, toasted, oiled, boiled, baked,
mixed, flavored, sweetened, salted, soured and put into the popular
commercial forms, it becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to know
what we are eating, or to estimate the results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Man is the net product of what he eats and drinks. Food bears
very much the same relation to him that soil does to vegetation. The
following questions, therefore, should be solved by every one who
believes that success and happiness depend upon health and vitality:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 How to select and how to combine foods which will give to the body
a natural result, which is <em>health</em></p>

<p>2 How to select and how to combine foods so that they will
counteract and remove the causes of dis-ease</p>

<p>3 How to select foods which contain all the chemical elements of the
body, and how to combine and proportion them at each meal so that they
will chemically harmonize</p>

<p>4 How to determine the quantity of food to be taken each day,
or at each meal, that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> give to the body all the nourishment it
is capable of assimilating</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: Too much food, even of the right kind, defeats this
purpose and produces just the opposite result.</p></blockquote>


<p class="p4">Upon this knowledge hinges the building of a natural body, the cure
of a vast majority of dis-eases, our ability to reach the highest
state of physical and mental vitality, the prolongation of youth and
longevity.</p>


<p class="p2">OUR FOOD MUST FIT INTO OUR CIVILIZATION</p>

<p><em>We must make our diet fit into our civilized requirements.</em>
Civilization has imposed many customs, habits, and duties upon us that
have not been properly met by nutrition or diet. This is why nearly 91
per cent of our ills are caused by errors in eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of sedative occupations upon nutrition</div>

<p>Under continued physical exertion, the body will thrive for a time
on an unbalanced diet. It will cast off surplus nutrition, and convert
one element into another, a problem unknown to modern science, but
under sedative or modern business habits and occupations, it will not
continue to cast off a surplus, or to reconvert nutritive elements.
As a result of an unbalanced bill of fare, the nutrients taken in
excess of the daily needs undergo a form of decomposition, producing
what is called autointoxication, and become a most prolific source of
dis-ease.</p>


<p class="p2">WHY THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN NUTRITION IS
IN ITS INFANCY</p>

<p>The reader may inquire why it is that all other branches of science
have advanced so rapidly, and the science of human nutrition has just
begun. The reasons are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Our ancestors, for many thousand years, were taught that dis-ease
was a visitation of Divine Providence, therefore to combat it was to
tempt the Almighty.</p>

<p>2 Doctors of medicine who have been custodians of the people's
health for many centuries have seldom been food scientists. Most of
them attempt to combat disease with drugs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we are beginning to learn the truth about the origin of
disease and in considering the body as a human engine, to take into
consideration the all-important question of fuel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tendency of the modern physician toward food science</div>

<p>That the most learned physicians are drifting more and more
toward scientific feeding and natural remedies is a matter of common
knowledge. This splendid army of laborers in the great field of human
suffering is made up largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> of what is termed the <em>Modern
Doctor</em>&mdash;the man who is brave enough to think and to act
according to his better judgment.</p>

<p>Just to the extent that we understand the origin of drugs, and the
drugging system of treating dis-ease, we turn instinctively <em>from
them</em>, and instinctively <em>toward</em> food, for in drugs we
find an ancient system of guesswork, while in food we find fundamental
principles and primary causes. The majority of causes are removed when
the diet is made to fit our physical condition and environment, and we
then become normal by the process of animal evolution, Nature merely
bestowing upon us our birthright because we have obeyed her laws.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3 The true science of human nutrition can be evolved only from
an accurate knowledge of both food chemistry and of physiological
chemistry.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Why food chemistry and physiological chemistry have not been united</div>

<p>The science of physiological chemistry has been known and taught for
more than one hundred years, while the science of food chemistry is
of recent origin. These two branches have been kept separate because
they grew up at different periods of time. United they constitute the
greatest science known to mankind, because they affect his health, his
happiness, his life, and above all they measure the period of time he
will live.</p>

<p>Physiological chemistry tells what the body is and its
needs&mdash;food chemistry tells how to supply these needs. Recognizing
these facts, I have merely united these hitherto unapplied branches
of science, and have made of the union the science of Applied Food
Chemistry, which makes practical that which has heretofore been
confined mainly to theory.</p>

CHEMISTRY</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of chemistry to food science</div>

<p>If the student is versed in chemistry, this lesson will serve merely
as a review; if not, somewhat close attention must be given to facts
which at first may seem uninteresting. Patience should be exercised,
for, while all the information herein given does not, taken as a whole,
bear directly upon the subjects of health and dis-ease, yet with this
knowledge it will be much less difficult to understand the principles
which are applied later when we take up the chemistry of the body and
the chemistry of food.</p>

<p>Chemistry is not, as popularly supposed, a science far removed from
everyday life. Everyone has some knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> of chemistry, but the
chemist has observed things more minutely and therefore more accurately
understands the composition of substances and the changes that are
everywhere taking place. For illustration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A cook starts a fire in a stove. She knows that the fire must have
"air" or it will not burn; that when the fire is first lighted, it
"smokes" heavily, but as it burns more, it smokes less; further, that
if the damper in the pipe is closed the "gas" will escape in to the
room.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Fire, gas, and smoke the result of chemical
changes</div>

<p>The chemist also knows this, but because he has compared his
observations with similar events elsewhere, he is enabled to express
his knowledge in the language of science. To the chemist, fire is
the process of combustion&mdash;the union of the oxygen of the air
with the carbon and hydrogen compounds of the wood or of the coal.
The heat of the fire is generated by this chemical union. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> the
chemist, the smoke is a natural phenomenon occasioned by particles
of carbon which fail to unite with the oxygen gas. The gas, which to
the woman suggests suffocation if enough of it escapes into the room,
to the chemist suggests a compound resulting from combination of the
oxygen with the carbon.</p>


<p class="p2">CHEMICAL ELEMENTS</p>

<p>To the chemist, all forms of matter are mere combinations of
elements. Chemical analysis is a process of separating, dividing, and
subdividing matter. When the chemist separates or analyzes compounds,
until he can no longer simplify or subdivide them, he calls these
simple products "chemical elements."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common elements</div>

<p>Many of the chemical elements are well known, such as copper,
iron, and gold. Other elements that are still more common are
unknown in their elementary form, because they combine with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
other elements so readily that they exist in nature only as compounds.
For example: Hydrogen, united with oxygen, forms water; the elements
chlorin and sodium, combined or united, form common salt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number of elements</div>

<p>Altogether chemists have discovered about eighty-four elements, many
of which are rare, and do not occur in common substances.</p>

<p>All substances of the earth, whether dead or living, are formed
of chemical elements. These elements may be found in the pure or
elementary state, or they may be mixed with other substances, or they
may be combined chemically. Copper, iron, and gold are elements in the
pure state. If we should take iron and copper filings and mix them
together, we would still have copper and iron. Were we to take copper
and gold and melt them together, we would have a metal that would
be neither copper nor gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> It would be harder than one and softer
than the other. But this substance would still be a mixture, and its
properties half way between copper and gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples of chemical changes</div>

<p>If a piece of iron be exposed to dampness it will soon become
covered with a reddish powder called "rust." The rusting of iron is a
process of chemical changes in which the original substance was wholly
changed by chemically uniting with the oxygen and the moisture of the
atmosphere, which is really a process of combustion. The burning of
wood, the rusting of iron, the souring of milk, and the digestion of
food are, in a way, all mere examples of chemical changes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference between chemical compounds and simple mixtures</div>

<p>Care should be exercised to distinguish chemical compounds from
simple mixtures. Air is not a compound, but a mixture of oxygen,
hydrogen and nitrogen gases. Water, however, is a compound of oxygen
and hydrogen. Both salt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> sugar are compounds, but if we grind
them together, we do not have a new compound, but a mixture of two
compounds. Most of the common things around us are mixtures of
different compounds or substances. Rocks are mixtures of many different
compounds. Wood is, likewise, formed of many different substances.
Wheat contains water, starch, cellulose, and many other compounds.
Grinding the wheat into flour does not change it chemically, but if we
heat the flour in an oven, some of the starch is changed into dextrin.
The starch has disappeared, and dextrin, a new substance, appears in
its place. Whenever elements are combined into compounds, or compounds
broken up into elements, or changed into other compounds, we have true
chemical action.</p>

<p>The names of the elements are formed in many different
ways. The name chlorin is derived from a Greek word meaning
<em>greenish-yellow</em>, as this is the color of chlorin. Bromin comes
from a Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> word meaning <em>a stench</em>, a prominent
characteristic of bromin being its bad odor. <span class="sidenote">Names of
elements&mdash;how derived</span> Hydrogen is formed from two Greek
words, one of which means <em>water</em> and the other to <em>produce</em>,
signifying that it enters into the composition of water. Potassium is an
element found in potash, and sodium in soda, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Symbols of elements&mdash;how derived</div>

<p>For convenience, abbreviations are used for the names of elements
and compounds. Thus, instead of oxygen, we may write simply "O"; for
hydrogen, "H"; for nitrogen, "N," etc. Very frequently the first
letter of the name of the element is used as the symbol. If the names
of two or more elements begin with the same letter, some other letter
of the name is added. In some cases the symbols are derived from the
Latin names of the elements. Thus, the symbol of iron is Fe, from
<em>ferrum</em>; of copper, Cu, from <em>cuprum</em>.</p>

<p class="p2">AIR AND OXYGEN</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of air</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Air</span>&mdash;The air consists chiefly of two
substances, only one of which can keep up the process of burning. This
substance is known as oxygen. The other, in which nothing can burn, is
known as nitrogen. Besides these the air contains smaller quantities
of other substances, particularly water vapor, carbonic acid (carbon
dioxid), ammonia, and carburetted hydrogen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Distribution
of oxygen</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxygen</span>&mdash;Oxygen is the most common
element in nature. It forms between forty and fifty per cent of the
solid crust of the earth, eight-ninths of all the water on the globe,
and one-fifth of all the air around the globe.</p>

<p>We have oxygen around us in great abundance, but it is mixed with
nitrogen, and it is difficult to separate the two so as to secure the
oxygen for any practical or commercial use.</p>


<p class="p2">MANUFACTURE OF OXYGEN</p>

<p>There are three methods of obtaining oxygen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p4">1 From <em>potassium chlorate</em>, or, as
it is commonly called, chlorate of
potash.</p>

<p class="p4">When potassium chlorate (KCLO<sub>3</sub>) is heated in a closed
vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> (closed vessel means "closed at one end"), it breaks up
into potassium chlorid and oxygen; that is, KCLO<sub>3</sub> + heat = KCL +
O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="p4">Potassium chlorate is used in fireworks because it gives up its
oxygen readily. Potassium nitrate serves the same purpose in gunpowder,
which is a mixture of sulfur (S), charcoal (C), and salt-peter or
potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>). The explosion of gunpowder, after
a certain temperature has been reached, is due to the formation of
oxygen, which, combined with the potassium nitrate, is set free by the
very rapid burning of the charcoal and the sulfur. Other gases formed
by the explosion are nitrogen, and probably sulfur dioxid (SO<sub>2</sub>),
and oxids of nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, etc. Carbon monoxid and
carbon dioxid are sometimes formed. Potassium nitrate, however, is the
most active agent in gunpowder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="p4">2 By the <em>electrolysis of water</em>.</p>

<p class="p4">By this method the oxygen and the hydrogen are separated by
electricity.</p>

<p class="p4">3 By the <em>liquefaction of air</em>, which is a very recent and a
very scientific method.</p>

<p class="p4">By this method the air is cooled down until it liquefies. At normal
atmospheric pressure it liquefies at a temperature of &mdash;312.6&deg;F.,
but under pressure of about 585 pounds it liquefies at a temperature
of &mdash;220&deg;F. After the air has been liquefied, it is allowed to go
back to vapor by exposing it to the surrounding heat of the atmosphere,
and this vaporization separates the nitrogen from the oxygen, as the
nitrogen boils at a temperature of &mdash;318&deg;F., while the oxygen
boils at a temperature of &mdash;294&deg;F. There is a difference of
about 24&deg; in the boiling points of these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> gases, which at this low
point amounts to more than the difference between the boiling points of
alcohol and water, and this difference is sufficient to separate the
oxygen from the nitrogen.</p>

<p class="p4">Production of oxygen by the liquefaction of air is the latest,
cheapest, and most approved method, and is now becoming extensively
used in obtaining both oxygen and nitrogen for commercial
use.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of oxygen</div>

<p>Oxygen is tasteless and odorless. It is slightly heavier than air.
When subjected to an extremely high pressure and low temperature it
becomes liquid.</p>


<p class="p2">CHEMICAL ACTION OF OXYGEN</p>

<p>(a) <em>Upon Substances</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of air upon iron and wood</div>

<p>Upon some substances oxygen acts at ordinary temperature. Iron
becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> covered with rust when exposed to air and moisture. Wood
and other vegetable and animal substances undergo slow decomposition
when exposed to the air. This is partly due to the action of oxygen at
ordinary temperature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pure oxygen aids combustion</div>

<p>A splinter of wood will burn brilliantly in a jar of pure oxygen,
and much more rapidly than in common air. Pure oxygen gas will cause
many substances to burn which will not burn in air. Iron can be burned
in pure oxygen, leaving only a reddish powder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of iron-rust</div>

<p>When iron rusts the carbon dioxid and water vapor combine chemically
with the iron, and form what is known as a basic hydroxid or carbonate
of iron. The process is somewhat complex. When iron burns in oxygen
a red powder is formed&mdash;ferric oxid, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Iron
dissolves in water, or moisture from the air containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
carbonic acid, forming acid ferrous carbonate&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;Fe &nbsp; + 2H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">=</span> FeH<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> <span style="margin-left: 4.6em;">+</span> H<sub>2</sub><br />
Iron + Carbonic acid = Acid ferrous carbonate + Hydrogen</p></blockquote>

<p>This acid ferrous carbonate, on drying or further oxidation, is
converted into <em>iron-rust</em>. If we represent <em>iron-rust</em>
by the formula Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. 2Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>, the equation is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="margin-left: 4.4em;">4FeH<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span> + O<sub>2</sub> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">=</span> Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. 2Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &nbsp;&nbsp;+ 8CO<sub>2</sub><br />
Acid ferrous carbonate + Oxygen = Iron-rust <span style="margin-left: 3.1em;">+ Water</span> + Carbon dioxid<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>(b) <em>In Living Bodies</em></p>

<p>The most interesting action of oxygen at ordinary temperature,
however, is that which takes place in our bodies and the bodies of all
other animals.</p>

<p>By the constant action or beating of the heart all the blood
in the body is brought to the lungs every two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
minutes. The actual time has not been determined in man. In large
arteries the <span class="sidenote">Rate of blood circulation</span>
blood flows ten times as fast as in very small ones. The usual time
through a capillary is one second. The time has been determined, however,
in lower animals. In a horse the blood travels one foot a second in the
largest artery. At present the accepted theory is that in the circuit the
blood makes throughout the body, it picks up the waste matter
<span class="sidenote">Oxidation of waste matter</span> from tissue that
has been torn down by work or effort, and brings it to the lungs, where
it meets with the oxygen we breathe and is oxidized or burned.</p>

<p>If the body undergoes excessive effort or exercise, it tears down
an excessive amount of tissue, and there is created, therefore,
an excessive amount of waste or carbon dioxid. Nature very wisely
provides for this contingency by increasing the heart action, thereby
sending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> blood through the body at greater velocity, forcing more
blood to the lungs, thus increasing the demand for oxygen, which is
expressed by deep and rapid breathing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Generation of heat and light</div>

<p>When a substance burns it gives off heat, and generally light. The
heat is the result of chemical change or combination, and the light is
the result of heat. Whenever oxidation takes place, no matter in what
form, heat is produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amount of heat determined by amount of
oxygen</div>

<p>The amount of heat given off by the combination of a given amount of
oxygen with some other substance is always the same. If it takes place
at a very high temperature, as in explosives, the heat is all given
off at once, but if it takes place more slowly, the heat passes away,
and we may not observe it, but careful experiments prove that heat is
always present in oxidation, and the amount of heat is always measured
by the amount of oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Law governing oxidation of given quantity of food</div>

<p>That the combination of oxygen with other substances always
produces a certain amount of heat is a very important fact to the food
scientist, as this law enables him to determine in the laboratory the
exact amount of heat that is produced in the oxidation of a pound, or
of any given quantity of food; this food will also produce exactly the
same amount of heat if oxidized in the human body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat and motion</div>

<p>We know that by means of heat we can produce motion. The
steam-engine is the best example of this law. We build a fire under the
boiler; the oxygen of the air unites with the carbon in the coal; the
combustion converts the water into steam; the steam is conveyed to a
cylinder; the pressure pushes a piston; the motion of the piston causes
motion in the engine, and the train or ship moves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Determination of body-heat and energy</div>

<p>From such facts we know that not only the amount of heat, but the
amount of work or energy that food or fuel will yield can be determined
with reasonable accuracy. Many conditions obtain in the body, however,
that do not occur in the laboratory, hence we must study these
conditions before we can fully understand the natural laws that govern
the production of heat, and energy or work, by oxidation in the living
body.</p>


<p class="p2">HYDROGEN AND WATER</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distribution and production of hydrogen</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrogen</span>&mdash;Hydrogen is found in
nature very widely distributed and in large quantities. It forms
one-ninth of the weight of water, and is contained in all the principal
substances which enter into the composition of plants and animals.
It may be obtained by decomposition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> water by means of the
electric current, or by the action of substances known as acids on
metals. The latter method is more commonly used in the laboratory.
Acids contain hydrogen, give it off easily, and take up other elements
in its place. Among the common acids found in every laboratory are
hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical properties of hydrogen</div>

<p>Pure hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It is not
poisonous, and may therefore be inhaled without harm. It is the
lightest known substance, being about 14.4 times lighter than air, 16
times lighter than oxygen, and 11,000 times lighter than water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chemical properties of hydrogen</div>

<p>Hydrogen does not unite with oxygen at ordinary temperatures,
but, like wood and most other fuel substances, needs to be heated up
to the kindling temperature before it will burn. Hydrogen burns if
a lighted match be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> to it. The flame is colorless, or very
slightly blue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decomposition of water</div>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Water</span>&mdash;Water is a compound and not
an element, as can be shown by passing an electric current through it.
If the ends of two wires, each connected with an electric battery, be
put a short distance apart, in acidulated water, it will be noticed
that bubbles of gas rise from each wire. As these gases cannot come
from, or through the wires, they must be formed from the water. If
they be analyzed, we will find that oxygen gas comes from one wire and
hydrogen from the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportion of hydrogen and oxygen in water</div>

<p>This experiment shows that when an electric current is passed
through water, hydrogen and oxygen are obtained, and also that there
is obtained twice as much hydrogen as oxygen by volume. This proves
that water is not an element,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> but a compound of two atoms of hydrogen
and one of oxygen. The chemist therefore writes the symbol for water
H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>We have just learned that with electricity we could decompose the
compound water into its elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Now we can
prove by another experiment that water contains these two elements. If
we burn hydrogen gas, or any substance containing hydrogen, water is
formed. This can be illustrated by inverting a cool, dry tumbler over a
gas flame, which is composed chiefly of hydrogen, and water vapor will
collect on the inside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of water</div>

<p>Though water is widely distributed over the earth, we never find
it absolutely pure in nature. All natural waters contain foreign
substances in solution. These substances are taken up from the air, or
from the earth. Pure water is colorless, tasteless, and odorless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Why ice floats</div>

<p>On cooling, water contracts until it reaches the temperature of
4&deg; Centigrade (39&deg; Fahrenheit). When cooled from 4&deg; to 0&deg;
C. it expands, and the specific gravity, or weight compared with the
space occupied by ice, is somewhat less than that of water; hence ice
floats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rain-water</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mineral water</div>

<p>The purest water found in nature is rain-water, particularly that
which falls after it has rained for some time; that which first falls
always contains impurities from the air. As soon as rain-water comes in
contact with the earth and begins its course toward the sea, it also
begins to take up various substances according to the character of the
soil with which it comes in contact. Mountain streams which flow over
rocky beds, particularly beds of sandstone, contain very pure water.
<span class="sidenote">Hard water</span> Streams which flow over
limestone dissolve some of the stone, and the water becomes "hard."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The many varieties of mineral water from the various springs
throughout the country, take their properties from soluble substances
with which they come in contact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salt water</div>

<p>Common salt is deposited in large quantities in different parts of
the earth. Since salt is readily soluble in water, many streams pick up
large quantities of it, and as all water courses ultimately find their
way to the ocean, the latter becomes a repository for salt with which
the earth-water is laden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effervescent waters</div>

<p>Effervescent waters all contain some gas, usually carbonic acid gas
in solution, and they merely give up or set free a part of it when
placed in open vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sulfur water</div>

<p>Sulfur water contains a compound of hydrogen and sulfur, called
hydrogen sulfid or sulfureted hydrogen, which we will refer to in its
order later in this lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Distilled water</div>

<p>Water may be purified by means of distillation. This consists in
boiling the water and condensing the vapor by passing it through a
tube which is kept cool by surrounding it with cold water. By means of
distillation most substances in solution in water can be eliminated.
Substances, however, which evaporate like water, will, of course, pass
off with the water vapor. Aboard ship salt water is distilled and thus
made fit for drinking. In chemical laboratories ordinary water is
distilled in order to purify it for chemical work.</p>


<p class="p2">USES OF WATER IN CHEMISTRY</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of water in physiological chemistry</div>

<p>Water is termed by the chemist a stable compound. This means
that it is difficult to get it to act chemically. Being thus
inactive chemically, we find that water does not combine with most
substances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> There are exceptions to this, however, especially in
physiological chemistry, an instance being that starch combines with
water when it is changed to sugar in the process of digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water as a solvent</div>

<p>Water is the universal solvent. A greater number of substances
dissolve in it than in any other liquid. Chemical operations are
frequently carried on in solution, that is to say, the substances which
are to act chemically upon each other are first dissolved in water.
The object of this is to get the substances into as close contact
as possible. If we rub two solids together, the particles remain
slightly separated, no matter how finely the mixture may be powdered.
If, however, the substances are dissolved and the solutions poured
together, the particles of the liquid move so freely among each other
that they come in direct contact, thus aiding chemical action. In some
cases substances which do not act on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> other at all when
brought together in dry condition, act readily when brought together in
solution.</p>

<p>There is a limit to the amount of any substance which can be held in
solution at a given temperature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chemical meaning of solution</div>

<p>The question will probably arise in the mind of the student as to
whether a substance dissolved in water has chemically united with the
water, or is merely mixed. Solution is in reality a process about half
way between mixing dry substances and forming chemical combinations.
The chemist considers that the water does not form a compound with the
substance dissolved, when he can, by evaporating the water, get the
substance back into its original form.</p>


<p class="p2">IMPORTANCE OF SOLUTION TO THE
FOOD SCIENTIST</p>



<p>Solution is very important in the study of foods and human
nutrition. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> substances which can be dissolved can
be assimilated. Many substances which <span class="sidenote">Relation
of solution to assimilation</span> will not dissolve in pure water will
dissolve in water which contains something else in solution. The blood
is water containing many things in solution. The salts of the blood keep
the other food elements in solution, many of which would not dissolve if
the blood did not contain these salts. The chief work of the digestive
juices is to reduce foods to a soluble form so that they can be taken
into the circulation by absorption; otherwise they would pass through the
alimentary canal practically unchanged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk as an example of both "Solution" and "Mixture"</div>

<p>We must learn to distinguish carefully between chemical solution and
merely mixing things with water. A good example is milk. In addition
to water, milk contains principally fat, sugar, and casein. The sugar
is truly dissolved in the water. The fat and the casein are fine
particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> held in suspension. If the milk stands for a while, the
fat particles rise to the top as cream. If it stands long enough, the
casein particles adhere to each other and settle to the bottom, leaving
the water with the dissolved sugar or whey in the middle.</p>


<p class="p2">IMPORTANCE OF WATER IN THE HUMAN BODY</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportion of water and solids in the human
body</div>

<p>Water, which forms about sixty-six per cent of the human body, is
by far the most important substance therein. It comprises the major
part of the blood serum and every tissue and organ. If a normal human
body weighing 150 pounds were put into an oven and thoroughly dried,
there would be left only about 50 pounds of solid matter, all the
rest being water. The proportion of water in animal and vegetable
substances is also very great. As water is also a conspicuous factor in
all foods, either in chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> combination, or in solution with other
elements mechanically mixed, it is obvious that water is an important
factor in food science.</p>


<p class="p2">USES OF WATER IN THE BODY</p>

<p>The uses of water in the body may be roughly grouped into three
divisions, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p4">1 Water in small quantities enters into the actual chemical
composition of the body.</p>

<p class="p4">As we will notice in the discussion of carbohydrates, water combines
chemically with cane-sugar when it is digested and transformed into
glucose. (See Lesson IV, "Cane-sugar," page <a href="#Page_112">112.</a>)</p>

<p class="p4">2 Water forms a portion of the tissues and acts as a solvent in the
body-fluids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What blood carries in solution</div>

<p class="p4">In this function the water is not changed chemically, but is only
mixed with other substances; thus the blood is in reality water with
glucose, peptone, etc., in solution, and carrying along with them red
blood-corpuscles and fatty globules.</p>

<p class="p4">3 Water is a most important factor in the digestion, and the
assimilation of food, and the elimination of waste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drinking with meals</div>

<p class="p4">Inasmuch as the body is nearly two-thirds water, it follows that the
diet should be composed of about 66 per cent moisture. The old theory
of dietitians that no water should be taken with meals was based upon
the hypothesis that the water diluted the gastric juice, and that this
diluted form of the gastric juice weakened its digestive power. Actual
practise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> has proved this thesis to be untrue. Water is the great
universal solvent, and the hydrochloric acid of the stomach is only a
helper, as it were, in the dissolution or the preparation of food for
digestion.</p>

<p>Water is also a valuable agent in the elimination of
body-poisons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of water to blood</div>

<p>The liberal use of water keeps the blood supplied with the necessary
moisture, and that excess which is eliminated through the kidneys
carries away poisons that would reside in the body very much to the
detriment of health. There is little danger, therefore, in drinking too
much pure water, but much care should be exercised that it be pure, or
at least free from lime and mineral deposits. The best water is pure
water, free from all mineral substances.</p></blockquote>

<p>If a meal consists of watery food, such as fresh vegetables,
salads, etc., then the drinking of water becomes unnecessary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but <span class="sidenote">When water drinking is unnecessary</span>
where the meal is composed chiefly of solids, then an amount of water
should be taken sufficient to make up 66 per cent of the total. If more
water is taken than is necessary for this purpose, the excess will pass
off and the stomach will only retain the necessary amount; but if the
quantity of moisture is insufficient, the stomach calls to its aid an
excess of hydrochloric acid, the strength of which has a tendency to
crystallize the starch atom (especially cereal starch), thereby causing
the blood-crystal, which is one of the primary causes of rheumatism, gout,
<span class="sidenote">Disorders caused by insufficient moisture</span>
lumbago, arterial sclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and
all disorders caused by congestion throughout the capillary and the
arterial systems. The most common disorder among civilized people is
hydrochloric acid fermentation. Copious water drinking at meals is the
logical remedy for this disorder.</p>

<p>The proper amount of pure non-mineral water taken with food will do
much to remove the causes of superacidity and the long train of ills
that follow this disorder. (See "Chart," Lesson I, page <a href="#Page_9">9.</a>)</p>

<p>In this work I shall constantly refer to these various uses of
water, especially as a solvent (an aid to digestion), and as a remedial
and curative agent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man's source of water</div>

<p>Theories have been promulgated by hygienic teachers in the past
few years that man should get his supply of water wholly from the
juices of fruits, and not drink ground-waters, which are contaminated
with mineral substances. While it may be true that water in certain
localities, such as in the alkali deserts, is unfit for drinking, yet
the writer believes that the promulgators of the theory that man is
not a drinking animal never did a hard day's work in a harvest field.
In the dry winds of the western plains water evaporates from the
surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> body at the rate of twelve or fifteen pounds a day. The
theory of deriving one's water supply wholly from fruits would not
stand the test of such facts.</p>


<p class="p2">NITROGEN AND NITROGEN COMPOUNDS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of nitrogen</div>

<p>We have learned that the air is composed chiefly of oxygen and
nitrogen. These are not combined as oxygen and hydrogen are in water,
but are simply mixed together, four-fifths of the mixture being
nitrogen. Nitrogen is also found in combination in a large number
of substances in nature. It is found in the nitrates, as salt-peter
or potassium nitrate, KNO<sub>3</sub>, and Chili salt-peter or sodium
nitrate, NaNO<sub>3</sub>. It is also found in the form of ammonia, which
is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen of the formula NH<sub>3</sub>, and
exists in that form in a limited quantity of the air. In most foods,
especially in those of animal origin, nitrogen occurs in chemical
combination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of nitrogen</div>

<p>Nitrogen is a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas which does not
burn, and does not combine readily with oxygen, or with any other
element except at a very high temperature, and except in the formation
of living plants, or in animal life. Just as nitrogen does not support
combustion, so also it does not support life. An animal would die
confined in a tank of nitrogen, not on account of any active poisonous
properties in the nitrogen, but for lack of oxygen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compounds of nitrogen</div>

<p>When a compound containing carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen is heated
in a closed vessel, so that the air is excluded, and so that it cannot
burn, the nitrogen passes out of the compound, not as nitrogen, but
in combination with hydrogen, which forms ammonia. Nearly all animal
substances contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
give off ammonia when heated as above described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why ammonia is used in making artificial ice</div>

<p>Ammonia is written by the chemist NH<sub>3</sub>, or one part of nitrogen
gas to three parts of hydrogen. It is a colorless, transparent gas with
a very penetrating, characteristic odor. In concentrated form it causes
suffocation. It is but little more than half as heavy as air. It is
easily converted into liquid form by pressure and cold. When pressure
is removed from the liquefied ammonia, it passes back very rapidly
into gaseous form, and in so doing it absorbs heat. Investigators have
taken advantage of these facts and are employing liquid ammonia in the
manufacture of artificial ice.</p>

<p>While air is merely a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, this does not
prove that these two elements cannot unite. In fact they do unite in
five different proportions so as to form five different substances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
These are given below to illustrate how different substances can be
formed from <span class="sidenote">Importance of proportioning food</span>
the same things, by merely combining them in different proportions. This
example is also given to impress upon the mind of the practitioner the
great importance of proportioning nutritive elements in diet so that the
patient will not be overfed on some elements while underfed on others.
It is absolutely essential, in order to know what effect a substance
will have in the laboratory, or in the body, to know not only of what
it is composed, but with what substances and in what proportions it is
combined.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the wonders of chemical
combinations, we give the properties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of two of these oxygen and nitrogen compounds:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties and uses of nitrous oxid</div>

<p>Nitrous oxid, N<sub>2</sub>O, is colorless, transparent, and has a
slightly sweetish taste. When inhaled it causes a kind of intoxication
which manifests itself in the form of hysterical laughing, hence it is
commonly called "laughing gas." Inhaled in larger quantities it causes
unconsciousness and insensibility to pain. It is, therefore, used
in many surgical operations, particularly by dentists in extracting
teeth.</p>

<p>Nitrogen peroxid, NO<sub>2</sub>, is a reddish-brown gas. It has an
extremely disagreeable odor and is very poisonous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition of nitric acid</div>

<p>By oxidation the nitrogen of animal substances is converted into
nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, the silent, continuous action of
minute living organisms in the cell is always tending to transform the
waste-products of animal life into compounds closely related to
nitric acid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> This acid, as its chemical formula indicates, is formed
by the combination of the three elements we have just studied, namely,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Pure nitric acid is a colorless liquid.
It gives off colorless, irritating fumes, when exposed to the air.
Strong nitric acid acts violently upon many substances, particularly
those of animal and <span class="sidenote">Properties of nitric acid</span>
vegetable origin, decomposing them very rapidly. Nitric acid burns the
flesh, eats through clothing, disintegrates wood, and dissolves metals.
It is one of the most active of chemical substances.</p>

<p>The compounds of nitrogen that occur in food are very numerous and
of complex composition. They will be discussed in Lessons III and IV,
pages <a href="#Page_99">99</a> and <a href="#Page_125">125</a> respectively.</p>


<p class="p2">CHLORIN</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of chlorin</div>

<p>Chlorin, though widely distributed in
nature, does not occur in very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
quantities as compared with oxygen and hydrogen. It is found chiefly in
combination with the element sodium, as common salt or sodium chlorid,
which is represented by the symbol NaCl.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of chlorin</div>

<p>Chlorin is a greenish-yellow gas. It has a disagreeable smell and
acts upon the passages of the throat and nose, causing irritation and
inflammation. The feeling produced is much like that of a cold in
the head. Inhaled in concentrated form, that is, not diluted with a
great deal of air, it would cause death. It is much heavier than air,
combines readily with other substances, and possesses the property of
bleaching or destroying colors.</p>


<p class="p2">HYDROCHLORIC ACID</p>

<p>Just as hydrogen burns in the air, so it burns in chlorin. The
burning of hydrogen in air or oxygen is, as we have seen,
simply the combination of hydrogen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
oxygen, the product being water in the form of vapor, and therefore
invisible. <span class="sidenote">Hydrogen and chlorin combined</span>
When hydrogen burns in chlorin, the action consists in the union of the
two gases, the product being hydrochloric acid, HCl, which forms clouds
in the air. The two gases, hydrogen and chlorin, may be mixed together
and allowed to stand together indefinitely in the dark, and no action
will take place. If, however, the mixture be put into a room lighted by
the sun, but where the sun does not shine directly upon it, combination
takes place gradually; but if the sun be allowed to shine directly upon
the mixture for an instant, explosion occurs, this being the result
of the combination of the two gases. The same result can be caused by
applying a flame or spark to the mixture. In this case light causes
chemical action. The art of photography depends upon the fact that light
has the power to cause chemical changes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance and preparation of hydrochloric
acid</div>

<p>I will here consider hydrochloric acid somewhat in detail, because
it is very important in the digestion of food, being the principal
fluid composing the gastric juice of the stomach. Hydrochloric acid
is always made by treating common salt (one afflicted with acid
fermentation should omit the use of salt and soda), under high
temperature, with sulfuric acid. This product is given off as a gas,
which dissolved in water forms hydrochloric acid, sodium sulfate
remaining behind as a result of this process. The chemist describes the
action that takes place by writing what is called a chemical equation,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="margin-left: 3.6em;">2NaCl</span> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <span style="margin-left: 3.2em;"> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HCl</span><br />
Sodium chlorid + Sulphuric acid = Sodium + Hydrochloric acid<br />
(common salt) <span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Sulfate</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The reader will observe that there are
as many parts of each element on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
right as on the left-hand side of the = mark. Two parts of common
salt yield two parts each of sodium (Na) and chlorin (Cl). The sodium
appears as <em>Na</em> in the sodium sulfate, and the chlorin as
<em>Cl</em> in the two parts of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>This method of expressing chemical action by these equations may be
somewhat confusing at first to those who have not studied chemistry,
but it is best to have all such become familiar with them that they
may have the further benefit of understanding the general terms of
chemistry.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid gives up its hydrogen when brought into contact
with certain metals like iron, zinc, etc., and takes up these metallic
elements in place of the hydrogen. Thus zinc and hydrochloric acid give
zinc chlorid and hydrogen.</p>

<blockquote><p>Zn &nbsp;&nbsp; + 2HCL <span style="margin-left: 4.8em;"> = ZnCl<sub>2</sub></span> <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">+ H<sub>2</sub></span><br />
Zinc + Hydrochloric acid = Zinc chlorid + Hydrogen</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">ACIDS, BASES, NEUTRALIZATION, SALTS</p>

<p>We have already discussed a number of substances called acids. It
is necessary to inquire why chemists call them acids. What is there in
common, for example, <span class="sidenote">Relation of acids to bases</span>
between the heavy, oily liquid sulfuric acid and the colorless gas,
hydrochloric acid? It is not possible to understand the nature of their
common properties without examining a class of substances called alkalis
or bases.</p>

<p>Acids and bases have the power to destroy the characteristic
properties of each other. When an acid is brought into contact with
a base, in proper proportions, the characteristic properties of both
the acid and the base are destroyed. They are said to neutralize each
other.</p>



<p>The most common acids are sulfuric, hydrochloric, and nitric. Among
the more common bases are caustic soda, caustic potash, and lime. A
convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> way to recognize whether a substance has acid or basic
properties is by means of certain <span class="sidenote">Common acids
and bases and tests therefor</span> color-changes. Litmus is a coloring
matter which is ordinarily blue. If a solution which is colored blue with
litmus be treated with a drop or two of an acid, the color is changed to
red. If the red solution be treated with a few drops of a solution of a
base, the blue color is restored.</p>

<p>Many substances change in color according to whether the solutions
in which they are present are acid or alkaline. An infusion of red
cabbage, for example, changes color when treated with an acid, and
recovers its color when again treated with an alkali.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of common salt</div>

<p>What happens in the chemical sense in this neutralizing process is
nicely illustrated by the formation of common salt from hydrochloric
acid and caustic soda, also called sodium hydroxid. When these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
two substances are dissolved in water, and the solutions mixed, the
chemical action is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">HCL</span> <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">+</span> &nbsp;NaOH <span style="margin-left: 3em;">=</span> H<sub>2</sub>O &nbsp; &nbsp;+ NaCl<br />
Hydrochloric acid &nbsp;+ &nbsp;Caustic soda &nbsp; = Water&nbsp; + Common salt<br />
&nbsp; (Muriatic acid) &nbsp; &nbsp; (Sodium hydroxid) <span style="margin-left: 3em;">(Sodium chloride)</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The strong hydrochloric acid with its pungent odor and sour taste,
and the caustic alkali with its equally characteristic properties have
both disappeared, <span class="sidenote">Common examples of neutralization</span>
and in their place we find nothing more wonderful than common salt
dissolved in water. Other forms of neutralization that are very common
are vinegar (acetic acid C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and soda, or sour milk
(lactic acid C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and soda. When bread is "sour," we
mean that there was not enough soda to neutralize the acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">PRINCIPLES OF NEUTRALIZING ALKALIS</p>

<p>If we should try many experiments of neutralizing alkalis with
acids, we would discover these general rules:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 All acids contain hydrogen.</p>

<p>2 All alkalis contain oxygen and hydrogen in equal proportions.</p>

<p>3 When these substances react, the hydrogen of the acid joins the
hydrogen of the base or alkali, forming water, H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>4 The metal of the base always replaces the hydrogen of the
acid.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span style="margin-left: 3.6em;">2KOH</span> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">+</span> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <span style="margin-left: 2.8em;">=</span> K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <span style="margin-left: 4.4em;">+</span> 2H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
Potassium hydroxid&nbsp; + Sulfuric acid&nbsp; = Potassium Sulfate  + Water<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (alkali or base) <span style="margin-left: 2em;">(acid)</span> <span style="margin-left: 4em;">(Salt)</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>(In the above equation the potassium (K) of the potassium hydroxid
replaces the Hydrogen (H) in the sulfuric acid.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>5 The other elements of the original compounds unite to form a new
substance, which is neither acid nor alkali, but which is termed a
salt.</p></blockquote>

<p>The names of a few common acids, bases and salts, and their chemical
formulas, are given here, as many of them will be important in the
pursuance of this work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fluorin</span>, <span class="smcap">Bromin</span>,

respects like chlorin. The first is a gas, the second a heavy,
<span class="sidenote">Formation of salts in the human body</span>
reddish-brown liquid at ordinary temperature, and the third a dark,
grayish crystalline solid. These elements all form acids just as chlorin
forms hydrochloric acid. These acids produce salts, and these various
salts exist in small quantities in the human body.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Mineral Sulfur</span>&mdash;This
element is of no particular importance or use to the body, as it is
insoluble and cannot be digested. The compounds of sulfur, however,
are numerous and important. Sulfuric acid, sometimes called oil of
vitriol, is one of the most active chemicals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> known, and is
especially destructive to living tissue, as it combines with the water
in the tissue so rapidly as to char or burn it.</p>

<p>When sulfur is burned in air it forms sulfur dioxid, SO<sub>2</sub>,
which is used for the purpose of fumigation or destroying
alleged dis-ease germs. This SO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in water gives
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, sulfurous acid. By oxidizing this another part
of oxygen is added, forming H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. All three of these
compounds are poisonous and harmful.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Hydrogen Sulfid</span>, H<sub>2</sub>S, is
a poisonous gas with a bad odor. It is formed by the decay of certain
food substances, such as eggs. Sometimes this gas occurs in intestinal
fermentation.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Carbon Disulfid</span>, CS<sub>2</sub>, is used
extensively to kill insects. The salts of sulfuric acid, or sulfates,
are quite important, and many of them are poisonous. Glauber's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
salt (sodium sulfate Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and Epsom salts (magnesium
sulfate MgSO<sub>4</sub>) are extensively used by the medical profession as
purgatives. These poisons cause the intestines to act violently in an
effort to throw out the offending substances.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Vegetable Sulfur in the Human
Body</span>&mdash;I have herein mentioned a number of sulfur compounds
which are foreign or harmful to animal life. In wonderful contrast
to this is the fact that sulfur is an essential constituent of the
human body, and in certain complex compounds with nitrogen and other
elements, forms the brain, nerves, and many other body-tissues.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Phosphorus</span>&mdash;This element is useful
in the manufacture of common matches because it possesses the power
to ignite by friction. The things of interest to the food scientist,
however, are the salts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> of phosphoric acid. These enter largely
into the bones, and to some extent into the nerves and other organs of
the body.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Silicon</span> is the element which, combined
with oxygen, forms the greatest part of the rocks and the sand of
the solid earth. It forms the shell of certain sea-animals. In the
human body it is found in the teeth and in the bones in very small
quantities.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Metals</span>&mdash;Metals, when united with
oxygen and hydrogen, form the bases of nearly all the substances
studied in this lesson. When these act with acids they produce the
salts. It is these salts of the metals that are of most interest to us.
The salts of common metals, such as copper, tin, lead, and iron do not
enter into the composition of the human body, and many of these are
decidedly poisonous, especially those of copper, lead, mercury, and
arsenic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of metals to digestive juices</div>

<p>The metals whose salts are found in the body are sodium, potassium,
calcium, and magnesium. These metals in their elementary state are
seldom seen outside a chemist's laboratory, but we can judge of their
importance when we remember that the digestive juices contain these
metals. The teeth and all bony substances are formed from these
compounds, and the ability of all body-fluids to carry food material
in solution depends upon a definite per cent of these metal salts. The
study of minerals, or of mineral salts contained in food, together
with their uses in the body, forms an important subdivision of food
chemistry.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Iron</span>&mdash;Iron is mentioned separately
from other metals because it not only yields salts that occur in small
quantities in the body, but because, like sulphur, it enters into the
complex nitrogenous portions of the body to form part of the living
substance itself.</p>

<p>This organic iron, as it is sometimes called, occurs chiefly in the
red blood-corpuscles. The patent medicines which are exploited for
the iron they contain, are frauds so far as nourishing the body is
concerned. The popular deception is caused by the general belief that
all compounds containing the same elements are alike in their uses. One
might as well swallow iron filings as to endeavor to build red blood
corpuscles out of the mineral solution of iron.</p>

<p class="p2">CARBON</p>

<p>In this lesson I will consider carbon and carbon compounds, which
are the bases of all foods and living matter. I will devote but little
attention to theories and technicalities, but will discuss the subject
from scientific and practical standpoints.</p>

<p>Wood, flesh, and other products of vegetable or of animal life
blacken when heated to a sufficiently high temperature. This blackening
is due to the presence of carbon. If such substances are heated with
an abundant supply of air, the carbon combines with oxygen and forms a
colorless gas; that is, the carbon burns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of carbon</div>

<p>The principal form in which carbon occurs in nature is in
combination with other elements. It occurs not only in all living
things, but in their fossil remains, as in coal. All products of
plant life contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Among the more
common of these are sugar, starch, wood, etc. Most products of animal
life contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Among these are
albumin, fibrin, casein, etc.</p>

<p>Carbon occurs in the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxid or
carbonic acid gas. It is also found in the earth in the form of
salts of carbonic acid or carbonates, such as limestone, marble, and
chalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various forms of carbon</div>

<p>The pure element, carbon, is found in nature in the form of
diamonds, which are pure crystallized carbon. Small diamonds are now
made artificially in electric furnaces. Crystallized carbon also
occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> in nature in the form of graphite, from which lead
pencils are made. Charcoal, lampblack, and coke are forms of amorphous
carbon which contain a very small percentage of impurities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of carbon</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the marked difference in their appearance, the
various forms of carbon have some properties in common. They are
insoluble in all known liquids. They are tasteless, odorless, and
infusible at ordinary temperature. When heated without access of air,
they remain unchanged unless the temperature is very high, in which
case they unite with oxygen and are consumed, forming carbon dioxid.</p>


<p class="p2">INORGANIC CARBON COMPOUNDS</p>

<p class="p2">CARBON DIOXID (CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>

<p>The principal compound of carbon and
oxygen is carbon dioxid, often called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
carbonic acid gas. This gas is always present in the air. It issues
from the earth in many places, particularly in the neighborhood of
volcanoes. With it many mineral waters are naturally charged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How carbon dioxid enters the air</div>

<p>Carbon dioxid is constantly formed by many natural processes. Every
animal that breathes gives off carbon dioxid from its lungs. This gas
is also formed whenever ordinary combustible materials are burned.
The natural processes of decay of both vegetable and animal matter
tend to convert the carbon contained therein into carbon dioxid, which
is thrown off and absorbed into the air. The process of alcoholic
fermentation, and similar processes, also give rise to the formation
of this gas. When fruits ripen, fall, and decay, the sugar, which all
fruit-juices contain, is changed to alcohol and carbon dioxid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">RELATION OF CARBON DIOXID TO LIFE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of plants upon carbon dioxid</div>

<p>Carbon dioxid is an important factor in the life activity of the
earth. The leaves of plants absorb carbon dioxid from the air, and
by means of the chemical activity of the green coloring-matter or
chlorophyl, the plant has the power of combining the carbon dioxid with
water, and with the mineral salts which have been absorbed from the
earth by the roots of the plant. Sunlight is necessary to this action,
especially in the manufacture of starch.</p>

<p>This formation of food material in plants by the combination of
simple chemical substances, such as carbon dioxid and water, is one of
the fundamental life-processes. Animals do not possess this power of
utilizing simple or inorganic chemical compounds, therefore they must
take their food substances in the more complex forms which have been
created by the power of sunlight acting upon the plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The wonderful carbon cycle</div>

<p>I have already explained how carbon dioxid may enter the air. Thus
we see that the carbon dioxid which is withdrawn from the air, by the
growth of plants, is constantly replaced by combustion, and in this
way the "carbon cycle" is completed. This is one of the most beautiful
adaptations in nature. If the plant did not remove the carbon dioxid
from the air, it would soon accumulate in such quantities as to become
detrimental to life, and, on the other hand, if this gas were not
returned to the air by combustion, by the breathing of animals, and by
the decay of plants, the vegetable world would soon be without carbon
dioxid, which is as essential to plant life as is the oxygen of the air
to animal life.</p>


<p class="p2">CARBON MONOXID (CO)</p>

<p>This compound is formed when a substance
containing carbon is burned in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
insufficient supply of air, as for example when the draught is partly
shut off in a stove.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of carbon monoxid</div>

<p>Carbon monoxid is a colorless gas. It burns with a blue flame,
forming carbon dioxid. The blue flame seen playing over the embers of a
coal fire is carbon monoxid burning. This gas is extremely poisonous.
Carbon dioxid, CO<sub>2</sub>, is not poisonous. The poisonous properties of
illuminating gas are due to the carbon monoxid which it contains.</p>


<p class="p2">ORGANIC CARBON COMPOUNDS</p>

<p>The carbon compounds thus far considered have been mentioned to
illustrate a few of the simpler or inorganic forms of carbon. We will
now begin the study of <em>organic chemistry</em> or the compounds of
carbon which are commonly found only in plant and animal substances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Combining power of carbon</div>

<p>Carbon has wonderful powers of combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with other chemical elements, and may combine with the same elements in
thousands of different proportions. This property of carbon to form so
many different compounds is considered one of the fundamental facts of
chemistry upon which life depends. For example:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Carbon and hydrogen compounds</div>

<p>Oxygen can combine with hydrogen in but two
proportions&mdash;peroxid of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and water
(H<sub>2</sub>O)&mdash;while carbon and hydrogen can combine in more than
a hundred different compounds. The simpler of these are acetylene
(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) and marsh gas or methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which is the
fire-damp in mines.</p></blockquote>

<p>The compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen number into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
thousands. A great many substances formed in plants contain these three
elements, such as fruit-acids, alcohol, sugar, and fats.</p>


<p class="p2">CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC CARBON
COMPOUNDS</p>

<p>Only a few of the most important
groups of the organic or life-formed
carbon compounds will be considered in
this work, namely:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub1">a Hydrocarbons</li>
 <li class="isub1">b Alcohols</li>
 <li class="isub1">c Glycerin</li>
 <li class="isub1">d Aldehydes and ethers</li>
 <li class="isub1">e Organic acids</li>
 <li class="isub1">f Carbohydrates</li>
 <li class="isub1">g Fats</li>
</ul>


<p class="p2">a HYDROCARBONS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uses of hydrocarbons in industrial chemistry</div>

<p>Hydrocarbons are compounds of the two elements carbon and hydrogen.
These compounds are very important in industrial chemistry. They are
found in petroleum, coal-tar, etc., which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> originally formed from
decaying and petrifying masses of plants. Gasoline, benzin, naphtha,
acetylene, methane, etc., are some of the industrial forms by which
hydrocarbons are known in commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coal-tar products</div>

<p>The industries based upon the chemistry of these hydrocarbons are
very complex and interesting. Coal-tar yields, by repeated distillation
and chemical reaction, thousands of compounds, many of which find
important industrial usages. Coal-tar dyes are very numerous and of
wonderful coloring power. They have been extensively used in the
artificial coloring of manufactured foods. The Federal Pure Food Law
attempted to prohibit this. In fact, it was the pernicious effect and
extensive use of these poisons that stimulated the passage of the "Food
and Drugs Act." Another interesting product of the coal-tar industry
is saccharin. Saccharin has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> food value whatever, but it is 280
times sweeter than cane-sugar, and is therefore used as a substitute in
sweetening some prepared foods.</p>


<p class="p2">b ALCOHOLS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varieties of alcohol</div>

<p>To the ordinary mind the term alcohol refers only to the
intoxicating element in liquors. To the chemist, alcohol has a much
broader significance. There are many varieties of alcohols, of which
ethyl alcohol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.HO), which is found in liquors, is only
one example. Another form of alcohol which is fairly well known is wood
or methyl alcohol (CH<sub>3</sub>.OH).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of higher alcohols</div>

<p>There are also higher alcohols, that is, those having more complex
chemical formulas, such as butyl alcohol. In the fermentation of
grains or fruits for intoxicating liquors, a small quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the various higher alcohols is formed. These higher alcohols are more
intoxicating and more harmful to the human system than ethyl alcohol,
and must be separated from the latter by careful distillation. The
poisonous property of green whisky and cheap liquors is generally due
to the presence of higher alcohols.</p>

<p>Alcohol does not exist in normal, fresh plant or animal substances
except in very minute quantities. It is formed from sugar by
fermentation. This fermentation is due to a microscopic yeast-plant.</p>


<p class="p2">c GLYCERIN</p>

<p>Another form of alcohol is glycerin (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It
is of special interest to the food chemist because it enters into the
formation of all fats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">d ALDEHYDES AND ETHERS</p>

<div class="sidenote">How formed</div>

<p>These are compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and
are closely related to alcohols. In fact they are formed from alcohols
by a process of oxidation, hence contain a little larger proportion of
oxygen than the related alcohol.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Uses of formaldehyde</div>

<p>An example of aldehyde with which many are familiar is formaldehyde,
which is used in laboratories for the preservation of animal-tissues
for dissection. This formaldehyde is a very strong germicide; that is,
it is poisonous to bacteria or germs. For this reason it is used as a
preservative of milk, a use which is forbidden by the "Food and Drugs
Act," because formaldehyde is also poisonous to the human system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uses of ether</div>

<p>Ethyl ether, which is used as an anesthetic or to produce
insensibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> to pain, will serve as an illustration of this group
of compounds. When analyzing foods in chemical laboratories, ether is
commonly used for dissolving fats.</p>


<p class="p2">e ORGANIC ACIDS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Properties of organic acids</div>

<p>It will be remembered that acids were studied in the second lesson.
It was found that the common properties of acids are a sour taste,
ability to combine with alkalis in the formation of salts, and that all
acids contain hydrogen. These same properties that were studied in the
second lesson in reference to mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and
sulfuric, apply also to the organic acids. The organic acids, however,
as a class are not so strong or active as the mineral acids.</p>

<p>All organic acids are compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> as alcohols and ethers, the chief difference between
these compounds and acids being that the acids contain a greater
proportion of oxygen. One of the simplest organic acids is <em>formic
acid</em> (HCO.OH). This acid is the active principle in the sting of
the red ant, and also of stinging nettles. It produces blisters when
applied to the skin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Process of making acetic acid</div>

<p>Impure <em>acetic acid</em> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is very well
known to all under the name of vinegar. Acetic acid may be obtained by
distilling wood. If it could be manufactured cheaply enough, vinegar
made from wood would be fully as wholesome as the best cider vinegars,
but this being an expensive process of manufacture, the temptation of
the food adulterator is to make the vinegar of sulfuric acid, which
is much cheaper than the mild acetic acid, but much more harmful when
taken into the body.</p>

<p>The formic and the acetic acids are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> examples of a series
of organic acids known as <em>fatty acids</em>. Other members of the
series are&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Propionic acid &nbsp;</td><td align="left">C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub></td></tr>

</table></div>

<div class="sidenote">Process of making soap</div>

<p>These fatty acids are very important to the food scientist as they
combine with glycerin to form fats. When combined with alkalis under a
certain temperature they form soap. Perhaps some of our older students
may remember the soap kettle on the farm at home, in which lard
cracklings and other fatty fragments of the animal were boiled with lye
or caustic potash to form home-made soap. The chemical action that took
place was a combination of these fatty acids with the caustic potash
or lye. The glycerin was set free and remained in the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the kettle as soft soap. Reference will be made to these acids again,
in Lesson IV, where the study of fats will be taken up in detail. (See
"Fats and Oils," under Lesson IV, Chemistry of Foods, p. 122).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxalic acid</div>

<p>There are some other forms of organic acids which do not belong
in the fatty series; that is, they do not contain the same general
proportions of carbon and hydrogen. One of these is oxalic acid
(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) which is found in certain plants, such as
sorrel, and is an active poison. Oxalic acid is used in the household
for taking iron-rust out of cloth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lactic, malic and tartaric acids</div>

<p>Lactic acid (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is the acid of sour milk.
Malic acid (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is found in many fruits such as
apples, apricots, currants, pears, plums, prunes, etc. Tartaric acid
(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is found principally in grapes. It is one of
the constituent elements in the sediment found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> in wine casks, and is
the active principle in cream of tartar. The latter is a potassium salt
of tartaric acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Citric acid</div>

<p>Citric acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is one of the most important
of the organic acids from the standpoint of the food chemist. It is the
active principle of citrus-fruits, such as grapefruit, lemons, limes,
oranges, etc. Lemons contain as high as five per cent of this acid.
Citric acid is often used to make lemonade, and if pure citric acid is
used, the manufactured product is equal to the original, except from a
sentimental standpoint of having the genuine. The danger is, as in the
case of adulterated vinegar, that the manufacturer may be tempted to
use cheaper mineral acids instead of citric acid.</p>

<p>The other above-named groups of organic compounds which are formed
from the three elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen&mdash;(f)
<em>carbohydrates</em> and (g) <em>fats</em>&mdash;are very important
to the food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> chemist. These will be considered in detail in Lesson
IV. See pages <a href="#Page_107">107</a>-<a href="#Page_125">125</a>.</p>


<p class="p2">ORGANIC NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS</p>

<p>If to the three elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the element
<em>nitrogen</em> is added, it still further increases the number of
possible compounds that may be formed upon the base of the wonderful
<em>carbon atom</em>. With this additional nitrogen factor, a new and a
distinct quality is obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The elements that make life possible</div>

<p>The chief characteristic of the element nitrogen is the ease
with which its compounds change their chemical form. To quote the
chemist, "the compounds of nitrogen are very unstable." Nearly all
explosives are nitrogenous compounds. When this element, nitrogen, is
combined with the wonderful variety of compounds formed by carbon,
we have not only a great many intimately related yet distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
substances, but compounds which readily change from one form to
another. These are the distinctive qualities or conditions necessary,
from a chemical standpoint, to make the processes of life possible.
<em>Protoplasm, which is the basis of all life, is formed by an
intimate mixture of a number of complex chemical compounds, the chief
elements of which are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of nitrogenous compounds</div>

<p>The organic compounds containing nitrogen are very numerous and very
interesting. As all tissues and substances of the animal body contain
nitrogen as a necessary element, we can see why this group of compounds
is of great importance to the student of food science.</p>

<p>Some of the nitrogenous compounds which are <em>not</em> available
as nutritive substances, and many of which are poisonous or harmful
to animal life, will be considered in Lesson IX, under "Alkaloids
and Narcotics." (See Vol. II, p. 349.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> The principal
nutritive substances, and proteids or compounds containing
<em>available food nitrogen</em>, will be considered in Lesson IV.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Four general classes of food</div>

<p>The chemistry of carbon compounds and the general composition
of plant and of animal substances were discussed in Lesson III. We
are now prepared to take up the chemistry of food. The chemistry of
food substances will be considered under the common divisions of
carbohydrates, fats, proteids, and mineral salts. (See "Classification
of Organic Carbon Compounds," Lesson III, p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classes vs. groups of related compounds</div>

<p>In the food tables and analyses commonly published, the above terms
are used with very little explanation, and read by the average person
with meager comprehension. When one reads that a food is composed
of glucose, citric acid, or globulin, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> is likely to become
confused, not being able to understand how a food at one time can
be said to be composed of carbohydrates, proteids, and fats, and at
another time to be composed of other substances. The explanation is
that the first classification does not refer to definite chemical
substances, but to groups of related compounds having properties in
common.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The different methods of analyzing food</div>

<p>There is still another way of giving the chemical composition of a
food, namely, to specify the chemical elements that it contains. It
will be remembered that the relation between chemical elements and
chemical compounds was explained in the first lesson. As an example, I
will take the analysis of milk. We will first say that milk contains
a certain percentage of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. We might
then say that the proteid of milk is part casein and part albumin,
and that the albumin contains certain percentages of oxygen, sulfur,
etc.; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> that the chief carbohydrate in milk is milk-sugar,
which in turn is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Or, we could
consider the milk as a whole, without dividing it into groups, and give
the per cent of each chemical element in the milk. Thus, the carbon of
the proteid, milk-sugar, and fat would be all considered together, and
show a certain per cent of carbon in the milk as a whole.</p>


<p class="p2">CARBOHYDRATES</p>

<p>The word <em>carbohydrate</em> means <em>carbon combined with
water</em>; that is, the element carbon is combined with hydrogen and
oxygen, which exist in the carbohydrate compound in the same proportion
as they exist in water.</p>

<p>The carbohydrates are closely related chemically to the aldehydes
and the alcohols, so far as their composition is concerned (See
"Aldehydes and Ethers," Lesson III, p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>), but this does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
imply that they have the same physiological effect in the animal
body.</p>


<p class="p2">CLASSIFICATION OF CARBOHYDRATES</p>

<p>The carbohydrates are divided by the
chemist into three classes known as</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub1">a  <span class="smcap">Monosaccharids</span></li>
 <li class="isub1">b  <span class="smcap">Disaccharids</span></li>
 <li class="isub1">c  <span class="smcap">Polysaccharids</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The principal subdivisions found in
these classes of carbohydrate foods are
given in the following table, arranged in
the order of their importance:</p>

<p class="p2">a MONOSACCHARIDS</p>

<p class="p2">1 GLUCOSE OR GRAPE-SUGAR (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)</p>

<p>Glucose or grape-sugar is the most important sugar known from the
standpoint of the physiological chemist. This sugar is normally found
in considerable quantities in human blood, and is absolutely essential
to the life-process, a fact which forms an amusing contrast with the
popular conception of the term glucose as something injurious or
poisonous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of glucose</div>

<p>Glucose is found in honey, and in nearly all fruits, grains, and
sweets. (For "Sweets" see Lesson VIII, Vol. II, p. 324). It may
be taken into the human body directly from such fruits, or it may
originate by the digestion of other carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Pure glucose crystallizes and resembles cane-sugar, but is not so
sweet. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
glucose of commerce, sold as sirup, is a product manufactured from
corn, or other starches, and will be considered more in detail under
the heading <em>starch</em>. (See "Polysaccharids," p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>).</p>


<p class="p2">2 PENTOSES (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>0</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of pentoses</div>

<p>Pentoses form a group of sugars, the chemical formula of which
contains five atoms of carbon. Each different pentose could be studied
in detail by the chemist, but the pentoses are of no particular
interest to the food scientist. They exist, however, in the coarse
parts of plants, such as stalks and leaves, and are of considerable
importance in animal feeding. From the standpoint of human food we will
remember that the carbohydrates of green plants contain a percentage
of these pentoses, but as they are never removed from the plant
separately, as are other sugars, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
consider their physiological effect in the particular plant rather than
separately.</p>


<p class="p2">3 LEVULOSE (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)</p>

<p>This is the companion sugar to glucose and exists in many fruits.
Levulose is often called "fruit-sugar." The composition of levulose is
exactly the same as glucose, but the atoms are combined in different
ways.</p>

<p>Levulose, for all practical purposes, may be considered the
equivalent of glucose in the human body. It is sweeter than glucose and
more closely resembles cane-sugar.</p>


<p class="p2">4 GALACTOSE (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)</p>

<p>Galactose, which is of the same composition as levulose, is another
companion sugar to glucose, and is formed by the digestion of lactose
or milk-sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">b DISACCHARIDS</p>

<p class="p2">1 CANE-SUGAR (C<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>)</p>

<p>Just as there are three monosaccharid sugars with six carbon atoms
each, so there are three disaccharid sugars which have twelve carbon
atoms each. The first of these is cane-sugar. It is commercially made
from either sugar-cane or sugar-beets, and is identical in chemical
composition from either source.</p>

<p>Cane sugar, when digested in the human body, or by artificial means,
combines with water, and forms glucose and levulose, as shown by the
following equation:</p>

<blockquote><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;C<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>&nbsp; + H<sub>2</sub>O &nbsp;&nbsp; = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> &nbsp;+ C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub><br />
Cane-sugar + Water = Glucose&nbsp; + Levulose</p></blockquote>


<p class="p2">2 MALTOSE (C<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maltose&mdash;how formed</div>

<p>Maltose is the second member of the disaccharid group, and is of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
same composition as the other two. Maltose derives its name from malt.
It is formed from the starch of grains by a process of digestion which
may be performed in the animal body, or by the process of malting.
Maltose, like cane-sugar, can be further digested into monosaccharid
sugars, but upon such digestion, instead of forming two separate simple
sugars, it is wholly converted into glucose.</p>

<p>The reader will now understand the meaning of the
terms <em>monosaccharid</em>, <em>disaccharid</em>, and
<em>polysaccharid</em>. MONO, which means <em>one</em>, is the simplest
form of carbohydrates. Disaccharids (DI, meaning <i>two</i>),
split up to form two simple sugars. Polysaccharids (POLY, meaning
<i>many</i>) are complex compounds which form many simple sugars.</p>


<p class="p2">3 LACTOSE (C<sub>1</sub><sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sub>2</sub>O<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>)</p>

<p>Lactose exists in milk and has the same formula as cane-sugar. Milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
contains about five per cent of this sugar.</p>

<p>When lactose is digested it combines with water as does cane-sugar,
but instead of yielding glucose and levulose, it yields glucose and
galactose.</p>


<p class="p2">c POLYSACCHARIDS</p>

<p class="p2">1 STARCH</p>

<p>The chemical formula of starch and other polysaccharids is written
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>1</sub><sub>0</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)n. This means that the proportion
of the elements is according to the figures given, but the number of
atoms that are supposed to be combined is many times greater than five,
and is not accurately known. This is purely theoretical, and of no
practical importance, except that it shows that the polysaccharid is
capable of being digested or broken up into many simple carbohydrate
compounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of starch</div>

<p>Starch is the most abundant carbohydrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
known. It is the chief constituent of all cereals, and is found in
large quantities in green fruits and tuberous plants. Starch occurs in
small granules, varying greatly in size in different foods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Potato starch</div>

<p>Potatoes are composed chiefly of starch and water. The starch grains
of potatoes can almost be distinguished with the naked eye. These
starch granules are not atoms or molecules in the chemical sense, but
are small receptacles in which starch has been deposited by the growing
plant. When cooked or boiled in water these starch grains swell into
a mushy, pasty or gelatinous mass; when cooked in dry heat until they
begin to turn brown, they are changed into a compound related to the
gum group, known as dextrin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solubility of starch</div>

<p>Starch does not dissolve in water as do sugars. If starch is treated
with digestive fluids, such as saliva, or with certain acids, it goes
through a complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
process of digestion in which it is first turned into soluble starch,
then into the various forms of dextrin or gums, and finally into
maltose or malt-sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How corn-starch is changed into glucose</div>

<p>Corn-starch, treated with weak sulfuric acid, changes the starch
into glucose. The ordinary glucose or corn-sirup is not all changed by
this process, into pure glucose, but contains some maltose and other
gummy compounds; hence it will not crystallize or granulate into pure
sugar. After the acid has changed the starch into glucose it (the acid)
is neutralized with an alkali. A crude compound is thus formed, which
settles to the bottom of the tank, and from which the glucose can be
easily separated. Commercial glucose is now very extensively used in
the manufacture of various food products, especially confectionery.
Pure glucose is a wholesome food, but there is some danger that the
commercial product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
may (due to carelessness in manufacturing, or to the use of cheap and
impure acid) contain various mineral poisons. Government testing of
glucose and similar manufactured products is, in the writer's opinion,
fully as essential as the government inspection of packing-house
products.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How starch is changed into maltose</div>

<p>Just as glucose may be manufactured from starch treated with dilute
acids, so maltose may be made by treating starch with malt. The brewing
of beer depends upon the chemical changes induced in starch by malt.
Barley is ordinarily used for this purpose. The barley is sprouted in
a warm, damp room, and a process of starch digestion begins, which is
necessary in order that the young barley sprouts may grow. This changes
the starch into maltose. The digestive principle developed in the
barley-malt may be utilized to malt other grains by mixing them with
the sprouted barley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maltose in foods</div>

<p>If this process of malting is stopped at the proper time, and the
sugar dissolved, and extracted, a product is formed consisting chiefly
of the sugar maltose. This is the basis of malt extract, malt honey,
and many similar foods put on the market, which are claimed by the
manufacturers to have wonderful dietetic and curative values.</p>


<p class="p2">2 GLYCOGEN</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glycogen&mdash;how formed and where stored</div>

<p>Glycogen is commonly called animal-starch. It exists in the liver
in small quantities. All carbohydrates are digested in the alimentary
canal and absorbed into the blood in the form of simple sugars of the
glucose group. When these sugars reach the liver they are again built
up into a complex carbohydrate very similar to starch in composition.
This glycogen or animal-starch is stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in the liver until the body has need of it, when it is changed into
glucose and given back to the body in the form of energy. (See
"Metabolism of Carbohydrates," Lesson VI, p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>).</p>


<p class="p2">3 CELLULOSE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cellulose&mdash;its purpose, source, and
importance</div>

<p>Cellulose, from the standpoint of human nutrition, is not a food
product, being insoluble by the digestive juices, but it is very
important in the digestion and the alimentation of other foods. Its
chief purpose is to excite stomach and intestinal peristalsis. All
plant products in their natural form contain some cellulose, though
the percentage is very small in such grains as rice and barley. The
bran of wheat or of corn is chiefly cellulose. Wood is almost pure
cellulose.</p>

<p>Cellulose can be digested by strong acids into simple carbohydrates,
in the same way that starch may be. Sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
can be manufactured from wood or rags, but the process is yet too
expensive to be applied commercially. Some of us may live to see the
time when the chief food of mankind will be manufactured from scrap
lumber and waste paper. Bacteria have the power of digesting cellulose.
The bacterial action or fermentation in the human intestines may cause
a small amount of cellulose to be digested, but the quantity is of no
consequence from a nutritive point of view.</p>


<p class="p2">4 GUMS</p>

<p>The gums include a group of rather complex carbohydrates which are
intermediate between starches and sugars. From plants are derived many
varieties of gums which have various commercial uses in the market,
such as gum arabic.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the formation of dextrin from starch.
Dextrin has no particular dietetic qualities that do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
exist in starch. It is, in fact, starch arrested at an intermediate
point of digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pectins in fruits</div>

<p>Pectins are a group of gummy substances found in fruits, especially
green fruits which are in the process of being formed into sugar.
These pectins form the basis of fruit jellies. Green grapes, as every
housewife knows, will make better jelly than ripe grapes. This is
because the pectins in ripe grapes have been transformed into sugar.
The pectins in fruit are in most cases wholesome enough, though it
would seem the better part of wisdom to eat all fruits in the ripened
state, after Nature has completed her work.</p>


<p class="p2">5 INULIN</p>

<p>Inulin is a compound closely related to starch, and upon digestion
with acids, yields levulose just as starch yields glucose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
It is of no particular interest to the food chemist, as it exists in
but very small quantities in starch, and has no distinct dietetic
value.</p>


<p class="p2">FATS AND OILS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition and formation of fats and oils</div>

<p>The fats and oils in food products, whether of plant or animal
origin, contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These fats
are formed by uniting the fatty acids with glycerin, which belongs to
the alcohol group. The particular fat that is formed takes its name
from the acid which enters into its composition; thus stearic acid
unites with glycerin to form the fat stearin.</p>

<p>The following table gives the names of a few of the more common
fatty acids and their corresponding fats:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Stearic acid ... ... &nbsp;</td><td align="left">Stearin</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Palmitic acid ... ...</td><td align="left">Palmitin</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Oleic acid &nbsp; ... ...</td><td align="left">Olein</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butyric acid ... ...</td><td align="left">Butyrin</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction between tallow and lard</div>

<p>A fat from any source will usually contain several of these
chemical compounds. The ordinary animal fats, such as tallow and lard,
are formed chiefly of the two fats stearin and olein. The different
proportions of these fats will determine the melting point or hardness
of the mixed product. Olein is a liquid at ordinary temperature, while
stearin is solid. The reason that tallow is a firmer fat than lard or
butter is because it contains a larger per cent of stearin.</p>

<p>Olive-oil, cottonseed-oil, and other vegetable oils contain large
per cents of olein, which accounts for their being liquid at ordinary
temperature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dairy butter vs. artificial butter</div>

<p>Butyrin is a fat found in small quantities in dairy butter, and does
not exist in cottonseed-oil and other fats from which oleomargarin
is manufactured. This is the reason that artificial butter lacks the
flavor of the dairy product, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
is remedied to some extent by churning the fats of the cottonseed-oil
and tallow with fresh cream, which imparts a small quantity of the
butyrin and similar compounds to the oleomargarin and gives the
characteristic flavor of butter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oils as active poisons</div>

<p>Besides the more common fats herein mentioned there are many other
fats that exist in certain vegetable oils in small proportions. These
fats give the oils their characteristic properties, and may render
them unfit for food. Some oils are active poisons, such as croton-oil,
which is the most powerful physic known. The power of all physics and
cathartic drugs is measured by the active poisons they contain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Packing-house uses of stearin and olein</div>

<p>When fats are heated to a high temperature they decompose and form
various products, some of which are irritating and poisonous to the
human system. In the manufacture of packing-house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
cottonseed products the stearin is often separated from the olein. The
granular appearance of pure leaf lard is due to crystals of stearin.
In the packing-house stearin is separated from the tallow in large
quantities. The stearin is used to make candles, etc., while the olein
is used for food purposes in this country in the form of oleomargarin,
while in Europe it is used under its right name as a cooking product.
It is equally as wholesome, if not more so, than lard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rancid fats made edible</div>

<p>Fats may become rancid; this is caused by the decomposition of
fat due to its uniting with the oxygen of the air. Rancid fats and
nut-kernels can be restored and made edible by heating them in an oven
until the oxidized fat is neutralized by the heat.</p>


<p class="p2">PROTEIDS OR NITROGENOUS FOOD SUBSTANCES</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proteids defined</div>

<p>The food substances which contain nitrogen are commonly called proteids,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or, if these compounds are considered together, the name protein may
be given the group. Protein is not a single compound, but includes all
substances which contain the element nitrogen in such combinations as
are available for assimilation in the human body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Only proteid foods contain nitrogen</div>

<p>Protein is the most important group of nutrients in the animal body.
The proteid substances in the body must be formed from proteids taken
in the form of food, because only proteid foods contain the element
nitrogen. All proteids contain nitrogen, but all nitrogen does not
contain protein. All proteids, therefore, are nitrogenous compounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of organic nitrogen</div>

<p>The animal body does not possess the power of combining elementary
nitrogen with other elements. Bacteria have the power to utilize the
nitrogen of the air to form mineral salts or nitrates. Plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have the power to unite the nitrogen derived from these nitrates
with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. In this way organic nitrogen, or
proteids, are formed. The animal body may digest these proteids,
however, and transform them into other proteid compounds. All proteids
contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen; most of them contain
sulfur, and a few contain phosphorus, iron, copper, and bromid.</p>

<p>The percentage by weight of the various elements which form proteid
matter is about as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Carbon ... ...</td><td align="left">52%</td></tr>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Amido compounds</div>

<p>Besides these real proteids there are a few substances known as
amido compounds which exist in small quantities in vegetables, and a
number of nitrogenous substances which exist in meat and meat extracts,
which are not true proteids, as they have little or no nutritive value,
but act as stimulants or irritants in the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ptomains&mdash;how formed</div>

<p>Ptomains are another class of substances which are often found in
food products. They are formed by the growth of bacteria, and are in
reality the nitrogenous waste-products of bacterial life. Ptomains
develop in meats and dairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
products held in cold storage, and are sometimes the cause of
serious poisoning. Nitrogenous waste-products will be further
discussed in Lesson VI, under "Metabolism of Proteids." (See p. <a
href="#Page_209">209.</a>)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources, coagulation and solubility of
albumin</div>

<p>Albumin is one of the commonest and simplest forms of proteids
known. It is found in the white of eggs, in milk, and in blood. It is
coagulated by heat, and by certain chemicals, such as acids, alcohol,
and strong alkalis. Albumin is soluble in water and in weak solutions
of salt, but it is not soluble in very strong salt solutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources and properties of globulins</div>

<p>Globulins are much like albumin, but are not soluble in water.
They are, however, soluble in dilute salt solutions. Globulins exist
in considerable quantities in the yolk of eggs, and in the blood. The
globulin in the body could not remain in solution if there were not
always present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a small quantity of salt in the blood. There are several types of
globulins. The fibrinogen of the blood, which coagulates, forming
clots, when the blood is exposed to the air, is a globulin. Hemoglobin,
which is the chief component of red blood-corpuscles, and which unites
with the oxygen in the lungs and carries it to the various tissues
of the body, is another form of globulin, and one which contains a
considerable amount of iron.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of casein</div>

<p>Casein is the most important proteid substance in milk, and is
familiar to all as the curd or white substance of clabbered milk. A
related form of vegetable casein is found in leguminous seeds, such as
beans and peas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of proteoses and peptones</div>

<p>Proteoses and peptones are proteids that are formed by the digestion
of other proteids. They exist in the alimentary canal in the partly
digested food. Peptones are readily soluble, and for this reason are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
easily absorbed through the walls of the digestive organs.
(See Lesson V, "Digestive Organs"&mdash;[The Stomach], p. <a
href="#Page_137">137;</a> also "Composition of Gastric Juice," p. <a
href="#Page_147">147</a>).</p>


<p class="p2">MINERAL SALTS IN FOOD</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vegetable mineral salts vs. common table salt</div>

<p>The subject of salt in food has received considerable attention and
discussion by scientific investigators, and many theories have been
advanced by those interested in hygiene as to the effect of common
salt used in food. The tissues and organs of the body contain certain
salts, without which life could not exist, but it does not follow that
these salts need to be supplied in mineral form. Common table salt is
an inorganic substance, while the mineral salts in green and fresh
vegetables are organic, and readily convertible, therefore a valuable
aid in the digestion of other foods. A diet of sugar, pure oil, and
artificially prepared proteids would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be absolutely unwholesome and would fail to nourish the body for
any length of time because of the lack of mineral salts.
<span class="sidenote">Foods containing mineral salts</span> All natural
food products, whether of vegetable or animal origin, contain a limited
but ever-present amount of mineral salts. This is especially true of
milk, eggs, and the seeds and green portion of plants. The amount
of salts in the human body is considerable, especially the calcium
phosphates of the bones, but the salts that need to be supplied daily in
food is small because the salts are not consumed as rapidly as are other
elements of nutrition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grains deficient in salt</div>

<p>Some grains, especially rice and corn, are somewhat deficient in
salts. At the Kansas Experiment Station some pigs were fed exclusively
on corn, and others on grain and green forage. At a certain age the
pigs were killed, and the bones weighed and tested for strength. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bones of the pigs which had been fed on a corn diet, which is deficient
in mineral salts, were about half as heavy and strong as the bones of
the pigs fed in a more natural way.</p>

<h3>LESSON V</h3>


<p class="p2">CHEMISTRY OF DIGESTION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Alternation of digestive juices</div>

<p>The digestive juices of the human body are five in number, namely:
Saliva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and the several
intestinal juices. Beginning with the saliva these juices alternate,
first an alkali, then an acid. It is the opinion of the writer that
this alternating plan is carried on throughout the entire intestinal
tract, as the final dissolution of food matter takes place in the
intestinal canal. These five juices are secreted from the blood by
special cells or glands. Each of these juices contain one or more
enzyms or digestive principles. These enzyms are highly organized
chemical compounds which have the property of changing other chemical
compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> without being destroyed or used up
themselves except in minute quantities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malt and yeast-cells</div>

<p>Malt, which was studied in the last lesson, and which is produced
by the sprouting of barley, is a true digestive enzym of the barley.
Yeast-cells are minute plants which secrete an enzym that causes the
fermentation of bread. It was formerly thought that the fermentation
of yeast could not take place except in the presence of a living cell.
This has now been disproved, as a German scientist has succeeded in
grinding up yeast-cells and filtering off the chemical compound or true
enzym which causes the fermentation of sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fermentation due to enzyms</div>

<p>It is now recognized by scientists that all processes of
fermentation and digestion found in plant and animal life are due to
definite chemical compounds known as enzyms. The action of digestion is
truly a chemical one, and could take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
place without the body as well as within, if we could manufacture the
proper enzym and could produce the exact conditions of temperature,
moisture, etc., that are found in the human digestive economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Predigested foods</div>

<p>The manufacture of predigested foods depends upon various processes
of fermentation, or upon the digestion that may be carried on by
inorganic chemical agents, such as acids, or by the ferments of
bacteria, or other forms of life. The following are illustrations of
these processes of predigestion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 The manufacture of glucose from starch by the action of sulfuric
acid</p>

<p>2 The malting of starch for the production of malt-sugar or of
fermented liquors</p>

<p>3 The making of cheese by the action of the enzym rennet which has
been extracted from the stomach of a calf</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>A great amount of discussion, pro and con, has been raised over the
subject of predigested food. The foregoing examples will show that the
subject of predigested food, taken in its broadest sense, cannot be
dismissed summarily with either approbation or disapproval. We must
consider the particular chemical process involved in each case and the
final chemical products, as well as its mechanical condition. These
things must be taken into consideration when we pass an opinion upon
the wholesomeness of a so-called predigested food.</p>

<p>With this diversion to illustrate the breadth and the importance of
the action of enzyms, I will now return to the consideration of the
chemical action of the human digestive organs.</p>


<p class="p2">SALIVA</p>



<p>The saliva is the digestive juice of the
mouth. It is secreted by three pairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
salivary glands. The secretions from these three glands are slightly
different in <span class="sidenote">Starch digestion in the mouth</span>
composition, but for our purpose may be considered as one secretion. The
saliva is an alkaline fluid, and the principal enzym that it contains
is a starch-digesting enzym known as ptyalin, which can act only in an
alkaline solution. As the gastric juice is strongly acid, the digestive
action of the saliva is stopped soon after the food has entered the
stomach, and the enzym is of no further use. The action of the saliva is
very weak, and the amount of starch digestion which is accomplished in
the mouth is comparatively insignificant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saliva and mastication</div>

<p>The chief function of the saliva is to moisten food and to
facilitate swallowing. From these statements one might first infer that
the emphasis given to thorough mastication is unwarranted. In fact, the
mastication of food has a much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
important function than the digestion of starch by saliva. This
subject will be referred to again when the physical condition of food
as a factor in digestion, and the nervous control or co-ordination of
the various functions of the digestive system are considered. (See
"Composition of Gastric Juice," p. <a href="#Page_147">147.</a>)</p>


<p class="p2">GASTRIC JUICE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chief function of the stomach</div>

<p>The importance of the stomach as an organ of digestion has been
overestimated in modern times. From the discussions in the average
text-book and physiology, one would be led to believe that the stomach
is the only organ of digestion, when, as a matter of fact, the chief
purpose of the stomach is that of a receptacle for the storage of food
for digestion further on. I do not mean by this statement that there is
no digestive action in the stomach, but I do mean to say that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
are no digestive processes completed in the stomach, and that all foods
which are acted on by the gastric juice can also be acted on by the
digestive juices in the intestines. This has been proved by the fact
that surgeons have successfully removed the entire stomach from both
animals and men without seriously interfering with the nutrition of
the body. They merely had to eat more often, as the depot or storage
receptacle had been removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inaccuracy of digestive tables</div>

<p>The stomach should be considered as a preliminary organ of
digestion. The tables published in the physiologies giving the
digestibility of various foods as so many hours, refer entirely to
the length of time it takes for the food to pass out of the stomach.
According to these tables boiled rice is given as one of the most
digestible of foods. As a matter of fact, the chief reason why rice
passes out of the stomach more quickly than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
other grains, is because it contains practically nothing but starch,
and as starch is not digested in the stomach, the rice is passed on to
the next station where it can be acted on by an alkali.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison of predigested and uncooked
cereals</div>

<p>In this connection it becomes necessary to refer to the
interpretation of the experimental results obtained by investigators
at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. In these experiments cereal products
which had been put through various processes of predigestion were
compared with uncooked whole wheat, the contents being removed from the
stomach after a given period. The results of this experiment showed a
greater amount of starch digestion in the case of the dextrinized or
super-cooked foods. These results were published as proof that starchy
foods should be put through a process of super-cooking, dextrinization
or predigestion. To those who are not familiar with food chemistry,
such results would appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
very convincing, but to a well-informed food scientist they only
illustrate how misinterpretation of scientific facts may indicate
conclusions opposed to the truth.</p>

<p>Starchy foods are not intended by Nature to be digested in the
stomach, but in the intestines, and the processes of partial digestion
of these foods, by artificial means, before entering the stomach, serve
only to interfere with Nature's plan, and to deprive both the stomach
and the intestines of their natural functions.</p>


<p class="p2">COMPOSITION OF THE GASTRIC JUICE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of pepsin on proteids</div>



<p>The gastric juice contains three principal enzyms or digestive
principles. These are hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and rennet. The
hydrochloric acid and the pepsin are secreted by different cells, and
could be considered as separate digestive
juices, but as the action of one is dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
upon the other, I will consider these actions as one. Pepsin, in the
presence of hydrochloric acid, acts on proteids, and changes them
into proteoses <span class="sidenote">Peptone and proteoses</span>
and peptone. Comparatively little food is completely peptonized in
gastric digestion. Proteoses are intermediate products between food
proteids and peptone, being the principal product of the action of
the gastric juice. Thus it is seen that this stomach-action is only
preparatory for the digestive processes of the intestines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of gastric juice on fat</div>

<p>The gastric juice does not act on fat, but in the case of animal
food, in which the membranes or connective tissues that enclose the
fat-cells are formed of proteid material, the gastric juice sets the
fat-globules free by dissolving these enclosing membranes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purpose of hydrochloric acid</div>

<p>The chief action of hydrochloric acid
in the stomach is to aid the action of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pepsin. Pepsin alone has no digestive power. There are no other acids
produced by the secretive glands of the stomach. If other acids are
found in the contents of the stomach, it is because they have been
taken in with the food, or produced by abnormal fermentation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How hydrochloric acid is formed</div>

<p>The source of hydrochloric acid is from the sodium chlorid or
common salt of the blood. The secreting cells of the stomach-glands
are thought to have the power to form hydrochloric acid by uniting the
chlorin of the salt with the hydrogen of the water. This is a very
unusual chemical process, and has not yet been successfully produced in
a laboratory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hydrochloric acid as an antiseptic</div>

<p>One of the chief functions of hydrochloric acid in the stomach
is that of an antiseptic. In other words, hydrochloric acid kills
bacteria. This is not true of all bacteria, for some germs can live in
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> acid medium, while others may live best
in an alkaline solution. The alternation of the digestive juices from
alkali to acid is a provision of Nature which has a dual purpose:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 To reduce food to the finest possible solution; that is, to
subdivide or to digest food elements into a form that will admit of
assimilation and use</p>

<p>2 To destroy bacteria and enzyms of plant and animal origin that are
taken into the digestive tract with food</p>

<p>(These two facts constitute additional reasons for the thorough
mastication of food)</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Object of alternating digestive juices</div>

<p>By such plan Nature provides for the digestion of food only by such
enzyms and ferments as will produce a finished product wholly suited to
the particular requirements of the body. When we attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
by artificial processes to digest our food with other enzyms than those
of our own digestive organs, or take into the stomach large quantities
of food without proper mastication, which causes fermentation, we may
expect that the nutritive material supplied to our tissues will not
be perfectly adapted to the needs of human cell-growth, and, as a
natural result, consequent derangement of the body-functions will take
place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rennet</div>

<p>The rennet of the gastric juice is primarily for the purpose of
digestion. Other than this it has no particular function that has yet
been discovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why stomach does not digest itself</div>

<p>The problem as to why the stomach does not digest itself has puzzled
scientists for many years. Investigations of the twentieth century
have at last solved this fascinating question. The walls of the human
stomach are composed of proteid material, and should be dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by the gastric juice according to all known chemical laws. The
explanation formerly given was that the stomach did not digest itself
because it was alive. This answer did not satisfy scientists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antipepsin in the blood</div>

<p>There has recently been discovered an enzym, known as antipepsin,
which is secreted by the cells in the stomach-walls. This antipepsin
destroys the action of the pepsin, thus in turn preventing its action
on the stomach-wall itself. Were antipepsin secreted in sufficiently
large quantities to mix with the food in the stomach-cavity, no
digestion could take place. The presence of this antipepsin in the
stomach-walls has been proved in the following manner: The arteries
leading to a portion of the stomach-wall of a dog was severed. This
portion, receiving no blood supply, did not form the usual amount of
antipepsin. The secretion of pepsin went on in the remainder of the
animal's stomach, but digested that portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of the stomach-wall which was receiving no blood supply; that is,
secreting no antipepsin.</p>


<p class="p2">BILE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Function of bile</div>

<p>The bile is a juice secreted by the liver and is alkaline in
character. It is collected by the biliary ducts to be conveyed into the
duodenum. The most important constituents of bile are bile salts and
sodium glycocholate. The chief purposes of bile are to emulsify fats,
thus aiding them to pass through the intestinal walls, and to stimulate
intestinal peristalsis.</p>


<p class="p2">PANCREATIC JUICE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Function of the pancreas</div>

<p>The pancreas is a secretive gland located entirely outside of the
intestinal walls, and produces a juice which is poured into the small
intestines at the point where the bile enters. Pancreatic juice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
is acidulous, and also strongly alkaline. As soon as the food, passing
from the stomach, comes in contact with the pancreatic juice and the
bile, the acid is neutralized, and the mass becomes alkaline.</p>

<p>The pancreatic juice contains three important enzyms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Amylopsin&mdash;acts on starch</p>

<p>2 Trypsin&mdash;acts on proteids</p>

<p>3 Steapsin&mdash;a fat-splitting enzym</p></blockquote>

<p>Pancreatic juice also has the power of coagulating milk, and is
believed to contain some rennet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of amylopsin</div>

<p>Amylopsin, the starch-digesting enzym, appears to be very similar
to ptyalin in its power to digest carbohydrates. Amylopsin completes
the digestion of starch that was begun by the saliva. It acts on starch
with great activity. One part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of amylopsin can change forty thousand times its bulk of starch
to glucose. This can act only in an alkaline solution, and if any
abnormal fermentation takes place in the digestive tract, producing
a large quantity of acids, the digestion of starch is stopped. It
is interesting to note that this enzym is entirely absent from the
pancreatic juice of infants. This explains why infants cannot digest
starch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison of trypsin and pepsin</div>

<p>The second enzym to be considered in the pancreatic juice is
trypsin. This is a substance distinct from pepsin, but its action is
the same. The chief distinction is that trypsin acts in an alkaline
solution, while pepsin acts in an acid solution. Trypsin is much more
energetic in its digestive power than the pepsin of the gastric juice.
It completes the digestion of proteids that is begun in the stomach,
and converts all proteids into soluble forms. A number of forms of
proteid that are not acted on at all by the gastric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
juice are readily digested by the trypsin of the pancreatic juice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fat digestion and absorption</div>

<p>The fat-digesting enzym of the pancreatic juice is steapsin. This is
the principal fat-digesting enzym of the body. This substance has power
to split fats; that is, to convert them into fatty acids and glycerin
of which they were originally composed. This fatty acid then combines
with the alkalis of the bile and of the pancreatic juice to form soap.
Soap is soluble, and passes through the walls of the small intestines
in this form. Having passed through the walls of the intestines,
soap is again changed into fat. The probable reason for which Nature
adopts such a complex process for the absorption of fat, is because
fat is insoluble. If the intestinal walls were so constructed that
fat-globules could be taken directly through them, they would also be
open for the entrance of germs and other foreign substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Frying fat unwholesome</div>

<p>Fat is not acted on by the gastric juice. This explains why the
process of frying is so unwholesome. Frying causes a thin film of
melted fat to spread over the surface of the starch and of the proteid
atoms, with the result that these atoms cannot then be properly acted
on by the saliva and the gastric juice, and therefore cannot undergo
the preliminary changes necessary to normal digestion. Fat, taken in
its natural form, does not interfere with other digestive processes.</p>


<p class="p2">INTESTINAL JUICES</p>

<p>In addition to the digestive juices that are poured into the small
intestines from the pancreas and the liver, there is a juice which
is secreted from the walls of the intestinal cells. This is called
intestinal juice or succus entericus. It is a light yellow fluid with a
strong alkaline reaction, due to the presence of sodium carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>One action of the intestinal juice is to change sugar and maltose
into glucose, which is then absorbed directly into the blood.</p>


<p class="p2">THE SECRETION OF DIGESTIVE JUICES</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recent discoveries concerning digestive juices</div>

<p>Within the past few years many remarkable discoveries have been
made in regard to the secretion of the various digestive juices. Until
some ten or fifteen years ago it was believed that the secretion of
the digestive juices depended wholly upon the presence of food in the
alimentary canal. The recent discoveries in this branch of physiology
are to be accredited chiefly to Professor Palloff, a Russian scientist,
and his co-workers. The facts that are now known regarding this part of
Nature's work are essentially as follows:</p>

<p>The secretion of the various substances which make up the digestive
fluids of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>the body depend upon two kinds of
stimuli:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Direct nerve stimulus from the central nervous system</p>

<p>2 The chemical stimulus on the walls of the digestive
organs</p></blockquote>

<p>Depending upon either or both of these sources of stimulation, the
digestive juices of the body are regulated in quantity, and what is
much more worthy of note, in their actual chemical composition. Thus
it will be readily seen how far-reaching in its effect upon scientific
dietetic treatment is the knowledge of the influence of various foods,
quantities, and combinations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative digestibility of foods</div>

<p>Professor Palloff's discoveries throw some very important light on
the comparative digestibility of foods. The former method of estimating
the digestibility of food was first to analyze the food, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
then to analyze the intestinal residue, and subtract the undigested
remnant of each particular class of food from the amount originally
eaten. By such means it was possible to show that certain foods were,
say 80 or 90 per cent digestible, as the case might be. By this method
no allowance was made for the amount of nutrition or material that
was consumed by the body in the digestion of these particular foods.
According to these investigations, milk and meat were about equally
digestible. It was not known that the digestion of milk requires only
a small fraction of the energy that is necessary to digest meat, or
proteids from vegetable sources. Thus it is obvious that when it is
desirable to get a large amount of available nitrogen into the system,
with as little expenditure of energy as possible, milk is a food par
excellence. This is very logical inasmuch as the sole purpose of milk
is food for animal life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative acidity and energy required in digestion</div>

<p>The amount of acidity in gastric juice that must be secreted for the
digestion of meat is much in excess of that required for a given amount
of vegetable food. The amount of acidity required is greatest for milk,
second for meat, and least for bread. The digestive energy required is
greatest for bread, second for meat, and least for milk. From this we
learn that starchy foods are unsuitable for those who are afflicted
with hyperchlorhydria or supersecretion of hydrochloric acid, as the
excess of acid prevents their digestion by neutralizing the alkali of
the intestines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insalivation of starchy foods and meats</div>

<p>The saliva secreted when nitrogenous food is eaten does not contain
as much ptyalin as that secreted when starchy food is consumed; for
this reason the thorough insalivation of starchy foods is much more
important than that of meat, milk, and eggs. Some authorities have
recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> advised that people should not chew meat
at all, but should swallow it as do carnivorous animals. This advice,
however, is not altogether sound. In the first place, man is not a
carnivorous animal, and the gastric juice of the human stomach does not
act as rapidly on flesh foods as does the gastric juice of meat-eating
animals, but if meat be taken into the human stomach, either in large
or in small quantities, decomposition may take place before digestion
has proceeded far enough to prevent the action of micro-organisms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental influence upon digestive fluids</div>

<p>The mental influence upon the secretion of digestive fluids may
originate from thought, or may be brought about reflexively by the
sight, or by the smell of food. All are familiar with the experience
of having one's mouth water at the sight of a particularly appetizing
dish. Many of us have undergone the same experience by merely thinking
of some particular food of which we are fond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Digestive juices vary with different foods</div>

<p>Scientific investigation has shown that the secretion of saliva is
only an example of what takes place in the other digestive organs.
The experiments of the ingenious Russian scientist, heretofore
mentioned, prove that the act of tasting and of swallowing food was
the chief factor in determining the secretion of the juices from
the stomach-walls. In a series of operations upon dogs, performed
by skilled surgeons, certain interesting facts were observed. The
esophagus was severed and made to open externally so that the food
swallowed did not pass into the stomach. The secretion of gastric
juice was then determined in the case of different foods which were
taken into the dog's mouth and swallowed, but which did not reach the
stomach. Not only did this act of pretended feeding start a flow of
gastric juice, but the juice secreted in the case of different foods
was especially adapted to the particular food, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to the general principle which we have already discussed.</p>

<p>These facts emphasize several important considerations regarding our
diet:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 We should eat slowly and get the whole taste out of food by
thorough mastication, because taste largely controls the secretion of
the digestive fluid</p>

<p>2 We should not disguise our food by high seasoning</p>

<p>3 Foods that do not require the same digestive principles should not
be taken at the same meal</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">"Fermentation" and "Putrefaction" compared</div>

<p>Fermentation is the term generally applied to changes that take
place in such food substances as carbohydrates, due to the growth of
bacteria, while the term putrefaction is applied in a similar way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the changes taking place in nitrogenous or proteid materials. Both of
these chemical changes are exceedingly harmful.</p>


<p class="p2">ABNORMAL CHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacteria chief causes of abnormal changes</div>

<p>Under this heading we will consider the chemical changes which
take place in the human alimentary canal, which are not beneficial or
necessary to normal digestion. The cause of the most important abnormal
changes in the contents of the stomach and the intestines is the
presence of living micro-organisms called bacteria.</p>

<p>In the lesson entitled "Evolution of Man," a general survey of the
history of man's development from lower forms of life is given. In this
general work I do not elaborate extensively upon the method by which
evolution proceeds, but those who are acquainted with the writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of Darwin, and other evolutionists, are familiar with the phrases "the
survival of the fittest," and "the struggle for existence."</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Survival of the fittest" among bacteria</div>

<p>As we commonly think of "the survival of the fittest" in animal
life, we picture the death-struggle of the captured animal, or the
fight for food in times of scarcity, or, if it be in the case of
plants, the crowding or the struggling for soil and sunlight. We can
apply the same principle to bacteria and to other microscopic forms of
life.</p>

<p>Bacteria, while minute masses of unconscious protoplasm, are, by the
laws of growth and reproduction, struggling for existence just as truly
as are the more conspicuous forms of life.</p>

<p>Because of the invariable presence of greater or less quantities of
bacteria within the intestines of all ordinary animals, some scientists
insist that their presence is in some way necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
related to the life of the animal, and is probably beneficial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments proving accumulation of bacteria</div>

<p>New-born animals, however, are free from bacteria, and the bacterial
germs found in the more matured animal must, therefore, have been taken
into the alimentary canal with food. Ingenious scientists have taken
new-born guinea pigs, and have kept them in sterile or germ-proof
compartments, giving them filtered air to breathe, and absolutely
sterile food. These pigs lived and thrived through the experiment
as did their fellows outside the bacterial-proof dwelling. This is
considered good evidence that bacteria accumulate in the digestive
organs of all animals, not for a purpose connected with animal
physiology, but because in order to digest and to assimilate food,
conditions are established which are so nearly like those required for
bacterial growth, that bacteria are produced, or take advantage of the
favorable conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> just as weeds, if given a chance,
thrive in a cultivated field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not all bacterial growth is harmful</div>

<p>I have already referred to the antiseptic or germ-destroying
properties of the gastric juice, and to other secretions of the
digestive organs. This would suggest that the growth of bacteria is
undesirable from the standpoint of man's welfare. There are many
species of bacteria growing in the human intestines, hence we cannot
say with certainty that all this bacterial growth is harmful, as,
in order to determine this, the resulting waste-products of each
particular species of bacteria would need to be considered separately.
We can, however, make the general statement that bacteria are abnormal,
or foreign to the human digestive canal, and that their presence is
detrimental to human welfare.</p>

<p>Micro-organisms give off various substances as waste-products of
their growth, dependent upon the species of bacteria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and the material in which they are growing. Thus the waste-products of
the yeast-plant are carbon dioxid and alcohol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waste-products of bacterial fermentation</div>

<p>In the alimentary canal there exists an abundance of carbohydrate
and proteid substances which form excellent food material for numerous
species of bacteria. The substances produced by the growth of these
various kinds of bacteria are numerous. They include the gases, carbon
dioxid, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfid, marsh-gas or methane, and ammonia.
Butyric, lactic, and other acids, together with alcohol, are also
produced as a product of bacterial fermentation in the intestines.
Perhaps the most detrimental of all are the substances produced by the
bacterial putrefaction of proteids, of which indol and skatol are the
two most important.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions the bacteria themselves do not penetrate
the intestinal walls, and their evil influence would be confined to
mechanical disturbance of gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
in the digestive organs, and to the destruction of a portion of the
<span class="sidenote">Solubility and distribution of bacterial
waste-products</span> nutritive material of food, were it not for the
fact that these harmful and poisonous waste-products I have mentioned,
are soluble, and hence pass through the intestinal walls with the
digested food material, into the blood, and are thus distributed
throughout the body.</p>

<p>It has been observed in the presence of intestinal congestion, where
the food lies in the intestines for an abnormally long period, that the
amount of these harmful nitrogenous decomposition products excreted by
the kidneys, is considerably increased, proving that these products
have circulated throughout the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of hardening of the arteries</div>

<p>Arterio-sclerosis, or the hardening of the walls of the arteries,
which has for many years been recognized by scientists as one of the
principal causes of old age, comes from two causes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The over-consumption of starchy foods, especially of the
cereal group; and (2) by the continued presence, in the blood, of
small quantities of poisonous material which gradually destroys the
protoplasm of the arterial walls, and causes them to be replaced by a
degenerate form of tissue.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example, alcohol and the poison of syphilis are prolific causes
of the hardening of the arteries. If the diet were balanced so as to
avoid excesses of starch and these toxic substances, the hardening of
the arteries would not take place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overeating an ultimate cause of old age</div>

<p>The poisons produced in the intestines by bacterial decomposition,
superinduced largely by overeating, are absorbed into the blood,
and undoubtedly their action is similar to the other poisons herein
mentioned. Thus they become a most potent factor in the cause of old
age and premature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> death, being practically universal
among all civilized tribes.</p>

<p>Numerous other disorders or dis-eases can be traced to this
same general cause, and the subject of the poisonous products of
fermentation and decomposition in the intestines will therefore be
constantly referred to throughout this work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The growth of bacteria decreased by scientific eating</div>

<p>From the deductions that have been made it is clearly evident that
any system of feeding which will reduce the amount of bacterial growth
in the intestines, would be desirable and beneficial to mankind, while
foods and habits of life that increase the amount of such poisons are
to be guarded against as detrimental to both health and life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overeating primary cause of fermentation</div>

<p>Overeating is perhaps the greatest of all dietetic errors in
bringing about a condition which favors excessive intestinal
fermentation. Overeating causes stomach prolapsus, thus reducing its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
mixing or peristaltic activity. This retards the process of emptying,
called digestion, which is the primary cause of fermentation. Under
this condition the antiseptic properties of the stomach-juices are
reduced, and the bacteria from the fermenting food is vastly increased.
The food, passing from the stomach in a fermenting state, produces
gas in the intestines, with the resultant ills that follow, such as
vertigo, dizziness, irregular heart action, and usually intestinal
congestion or constipation.</p>


<p class="p2">THE DECOMPOSITION OF FOOD</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sugar destroys putrefying bacteria</div>

<p>The putrefaction of proteids in the intestines may be reduced by the
liberal consumption of fresh sweet fruits. The preserving qualities of
sugar depend upon the fact that putrefying bacteria cannot live where
sugar is abundant. The beneficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
effect of sweet fruits in reducing bacterial decomposition in the
intestines, is due to the presence of relatively large quantities of
sugar and of organic acids. Sour milk is known to have a prohibitive
influence upon putrefaction in the alimentary canal. This is due to
the <span class="sidenote">Sour milk a preventive of intestinal putrefaction</span>
milk-sugar, which has been changed to lactic acid. This explains why
clabbered milk, which contains a considerable portion of sugar changed
into lactic acid by the action of souring bacteria, is especially
beneficial in preventing intestinal putrefaction. Professor Metchnikoff,
of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, became so enthusiastic upon this
discovery that he proclaimed sour milk to be a remedy for old age. While
Metchnikoff's enthusiasm is perhaps somewhat premature, yet the idea is
worthy of much consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proper feeding chief factor in reducing bacterial growth</div>

<p>We do not need, however, to seek for any one specific remedy against
intestinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> decomposition, but should study the
selections, combinations, and proportions of our food at each meal
with the view of reducing to the minimum the growth in the alimentary
tract.</p>


<p class="p2">DIGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS</p>

<p>It is well known that only a portion of the food taken into the
alimentary canal is digested and absorbed into the circulation. It
is obvious that the undigested food plays no part in the process of
metabolism, therefore it is necessary to know the amount of the various
food elements that are digested. For this reason we will notice briefly
the method used in making digestive experiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determination of the amount of food the body uses</div>

<p>The food eaten for a certain period of time is analyzed and weighed,
and the intestinal excreta, corresponding to the quantity of food under
study, is also weighed and chemically analyzed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
difference should show the amount of food actually digested.</p>

<p>There are several serious difficulties in the way of making accurate
digestive experiments:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Quantity of feces and time consumed in passing food through the body</div>

<p>1. It is very difficult to determine the quantity of feces
(intestinal excreta) that corresponds to a given quantity of food. A
digestive experiment is usually conducted for a period of about one
week, the man or animal being given a spoonful of lampblack at the
beginning and at the close of the experiment. The lampblack being a
finely powdered form of pure carbon, is insoluble in the digestive
juices, hence passes through the body without change, thus blackening
or marking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> the feces at the beginning
and at the end of the test period. The subject under experiment should
be given the same diet for a few days before and after the experiment,
so that the error due to the inability to accurately separate the feces
will be reduced to a minimum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Measuring the digestible portion of food</div>

<p>2. The digestive juices, and especially the bile, pour considerable
material into the alimentary canal which cannot be distinguished from
the undigested elements of food. However, it is fair to assume that
when large quantities of body-proteids are poured into the alimentary
canal, and passed out with the feces, this amount of matter is wasted
by the body, hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
should be charged against the food which stimulated the secretion. For
example: If grain causes a large secretion of digestive enzyms, it is
no more than fair to say that grain is less digestible than milk, which
wastes less body-matter in its digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Certain foods may either aid or hinder digestion</div>

<p>3. A further difficulty with the accuracy of digestive experiments,
and one to which in the past too little attention has been paid, is the
influence upon the digestibility of one food by the presence of others.
Some foods, such as fruits, aid the digestion of other foods, while
in many cases the presence of a certain article seriously hinders the
digestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
process of all. This emphasizes the great necessity
<span class="sidenote">The mono-diet system</span>  for observing the
laws of chemical harmony in combining our food at meals, and it also
emphasizes the importance of limiting the diet to the fewest number
of things possible, which in the opinion of the writer will lead
inevitably to the mono-diet system, especially in curative or remedial
feeding.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of determining amount of undigested food</div>

<p>From the standpoint of the above difficulties, all digestive
experiments thus far made are only approximately correct, and we are
forced back to the conclusion that if we obey the laws of nutrition,
Nature will give us her highest result expressed in endurance. If a
single article of diet is taken by a man who is accustomed to large
quantities of a highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
varied bill of fare, the digestive process will not act in the usual
way. On the other hand, if several articles such as nuts, grains, and
milk are taken at one time, it will be impossible to determine what
percentage of the proteid or of the fat from the three various sources
remains undigested in the intestinal residue, hence no accurate results
can be shown regarding the digestibility of each particular food.</p>


<p class="p2">MECHANICS OF DIGESTION</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition of food influences chemical action</div>

<p>Chemistry is not the only factor in the digestive function that is
to be taken into consideration. The mechanical condition of food, when
it is taken into the digestive organs, very greatly influences the
chemical process that takes place.</p>



<p>This involves the question of masticating or subdividing the food
into small particles. The greater the dissolving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
surface, the more rapidly will solution take place. If the substance
being dissolved is <span class="sidenote">Necessity for thorough mastication</span>
a firm particle, the digestion or solution will take place only on the
exterior surface, and the interior of the particle, however small, will
remain practically unchanged. This is what occurs when food materials
such as grains and nuts are taken in an uncooked state, as mastication
does not dissolve them, but only divides them into small, distinct
particles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of enzyms during digestion</div>

<p>If, however, the grain be subjected to prolonged heating with
water, partial solution takes place. The entire mass becomes mushy and
permeated with moisture. When such a mass is brought in contact with
the digestive fluids, it mixes or disintegrates with the fluid, just
as molasses would mix with water. The result is that the whole mass of
material is subjected to the action of the digestive fluids at once,
with the result that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
mass is passed from the stomach too quickly, causing congestion in
the small intestines, or the whole is arrested, and fermentation
and decomposition take place. In normal digestion, the enzyms are
continuously secreted for a period of several hours. They begin work on
the outside of the food particles, dissolving the substances gradually.
Thus the enzyms are continuously used up, and the digestion proceeds
slowly, but naturally, yet as fresh enzyms are continuously being
secreted to act on the newly exposed surfaces, active and complete
digestion is constantly taking place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Predigested "breakfast foods"</div>

<p>The alleged predigestion of certain proprietary foods has neither
scientific basis nor virtue. That the juices of some fruits which are
already in the form of glucose, can be immediately absorbed into the
tissues without any digestive process, does not prove that the mushy
cooking, malting, and other forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
so-called predigestion are beneficial. The so-called "predigested
breakfast foods" are not and cannot be prepared by any process for
final digestion, but are in an intermediate state between starch and
glucose. They are composed of a semi-soluble starch, gummy dextrin,
and perhaps a little maltose which has a tendency to disturb and to
interfere with the normal process of digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative digestibility of cooked and uncooked starch</div>

<p>I do not advocate the use of uncooked grain, but I wish to correct
a popular error in regard to the digestibility of uncooked cereal
starch. Nearly all works on physiology and diet make the statement
without reserve that raw starch is indigestible. This theory has been
established by putting samples of cooked and uncooked starch into two
test tubes, and treating them with some digestive enzym. The cooked
starch, being soluble, is all exposed to the digestive enzyms at one
time, and started on its way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the numerous changes in the complex chemical process of changing starch
into glucose, while in the sample of uncooked starch, the digestive
enzym attacks the particles from the outside, and slowly digests or
eats off the exterior of the starch grains. After a given length of
time the chemist adds iodin to the two test tubes. With starch, iodin
gives a blue color. In the test tube containing the cooked starch, all
of which has undergone a certain amount of digestion, no blue color
is discerned, for no pure starch is left, while in the other tube, in
which some of the particles remain unchanged, owing to the fact that
Nature does all her work slowly, a blue reaction is of course obtained,
and the chemist proclaims that uncooked starch is indigestible.</p>



<p>At one of the United States Experiment Stations in the state of
Kansas, a comparison of two diets, consisting chiefly of several
varieties of grains, was recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
made. The diets were alike in every respect with the exception that in one
<span class="sidenote">Government experiments with cooked and uncooked grains</span>
instance all the grains were boiled for two hours, while in the other
case they were taken in an uncooked state. In the case of the uncooked
grains, no starch whatever passed through the body in an undigested form.
In the case of the cooked grains, the same results were found; that is,
no starch was found in the intestinal residue. Other substances, however,
remaining undigested in the cooked diet, were much in excess of that in
the uncooked, yet no starch was present. In the case of cooked grains,
the digestive processes may start with more rapidity than in uncooked
grains, yet they are not thoroughly completed, and various decomposition
products occur, as well as undigested proteid, which is not likely to
occur with foods taken in their natural state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncooked starch harmless</div>

<p>Moreover, if uncooked starch be taken in excess of the digestive
capacity, and passed through the body wholly unchanged, no harm
results. The starch grain, in its unchanged state, is a fine, white
glistening granule, and its presence in the digestive tract would
have no harmful effect upon the body functions. Without solution, no
material can have any effect upon the physiological processes, except
by irritating the mucous surfaces of the digestive organs; in the
latter respect, starch granules are harmless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition in which food should enter digestive organs</div>

<p>With the exception of articles that are in solution, the condition
in which all foods should enter the digestive organs is in finely
divided, yet distinct particles, and not in pasty or gummy masses.
In this latter form "bolting" is encouraged, and mastication greatly
discouraged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">THE MUSCULAR MOVEMENT OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peristaltic movement in alimentary canal</div>

<p>Another point to be considered in digestion, and which may well be
classed under the mechanics of digestion, is the muscular action or
peristalsis of the alimentary tract. The best example is the swallowing
action observed in the throat of a horse, or of a cow, when drinking.
At each swallow, what appears to be a lump goes down the throat. This
is a wave-like relaxation of the muscular walls of the esophagus,
followed closely by a muscular contraction. This is the action that
takes place in the intestinal tract, and that which Nature employs to
move the contents along toward the final point of excretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">X-ray examination of peristalsis</div>

<p>A very fascinating and scientific demonstration may be performed
in the following manner: A cat may be given food mixed with some such
substance as bismuth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> subnitrate, which is opaque to
X-rays. Upon placing the animal under an X-ray during digestion, this
peculiar peristaltic motion can be observed, one "swallow" passing
rapidly after another down the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>This method of investigation has also shown that peristaltic action
stops immediately in the case of fright, or anger, but is shown to
proceed with regularity during sleep, contrary to the antiquated idea
that digestion ceases when sleep begins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk for relieving constipation</div>

<p>Peristaltic action in the lower parts of the alimentary canal is
stimulated by taking food into the stomach. This explains the laxative
action of such foods as fruits, or, sometimes, milk, taken at frequent
intervals. When all other methods fail, constipation can oftentimes
be relieved by taking a glass of milk every thirty minutes until four
glasses have been consumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Moisture and peristaltic action</div>

<p>The longer food remains in the intestines, the more completely is
the water absorbed from the residue. The object to be obtained in
relieving constipation is to increase the moisture and the peristaltic
action. Whatever will accomplish these things will relieve and perhaps
cure intestinal congestion.</p>

<p>The subject of intestinal congestion and purgative medicines will be
discussed at length in Lessons IX and XI, Vol. II, p. 375 and p. 436,
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><br /><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meaning of metabolism</div>

<p>Metabolism is a word used to describe all processes that take place
within the body from the time food is absorbed from the digestive
organs until it is passed out of the body through some of the excretory
channels. To be more accurate, it means the sum of both the anabolic,
or constructive, and the catabolic, or destructive, processes that
continually go on in the animal body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction between anabolism and catabolism</div>

<p>The process of metabolism is chiefly one of tearing apart, or of
breaking down, complex chemical substances into simpler forms of
matter. Formerly, all processes in animal life were considered to be
those of tearing down, or of simplifying, chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
compounds; while plant life was considered to be chiefly the process
of building up complex substances from simpler forms of matter. This
distinction, however, is rather general with many exceptions. The two
terms, "anabolism" and "catabolism" are sometimes used to distinguish
between the processes of building up complex chemical compounds, and
the oxidizing or tearing down of such compounds by effort or activity.
Thus, the formation of muscular tissue from the digested proteid
materials would be a process of anabolism, or construction, while the
conversion of glucose in the muscle-cells, into carbon dioxid and water
would be an example of catabolism, or destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catabolism a process of oxidation</div>

<p>The process of catabolism is, in general, one of oxidation; that is,
oxygen is added to the chemical compounds taken from the food we eat,
forming simpler substances which are excreted from the body as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
waste-products. Oxidized carbon in the body forms carbon dioxid;
hydrogen is oxidized into the form of water, while nitrogen leaves
the body in the more complex and incompletely oxidized substance
known as urea, the chemical formula of which is COH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. A
small portion of nitrogen leaves the body in the form of uric acid,
C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why muscular work produces warmth</div>

<p>The process of anabolism usually absorbs energy or heat from the
surrounding material, while catabolism produces heat as a result of
oxidation, as do ordinary fuels. This explains why muscular work warms
the body.</p>

<p>We may study metabolism best by considering the two purposes food
serves in the animal body, as follows:</p>


<p class="p2">FIRST&mdash;THE BUILDING OF ACTUAL
BODY-TISSUE</p>

<p>Every atom composing the human body is constructed from food. The number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and the proportion of the various chemical elements composing the
body are well known, and were it not for the fact that the body is
constantly casting out old cells and waste-products, the problem of
nutrition would resolve itself into the simple process of supplying the
body with the materials needed for growth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of new tissue and destruction of old</div>

<p>We could analyze an adult man and a new-born infant, and know that
the infant, in order to reach maturity, would need to add to its body
so many pounds of oxygen, carbon, sulfur, iron, etc. The problem of
nutrition, however, is more complex. Not only must we consider the
formation of new tissue, but we must also allow for the rebuilding of
the old, and for all those processes of vital activity that involve the
consumption of food material and the destruction of body-tissue. Nor
can this allowance be accurately proportioned from the analysis of the
body, because the various elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
composing it do not change with equal rapidity. Thus, a man in a
harvest field might pass through his blood in one day ten or fifteen
pounds of oxygen (in the form of water and carbon dioxid), which would
amount to ten per cent of the oxygen contained in his body, but if he
should take calcium or fluorin to the extent of ten per cent of that
contained in the body, death from poisoning would speedily ensue.</p>

<p>We can better understand the use of foods and the process they
undergo in building the body by considering separately each class
of food material from the time it is absorbed from the alimentary
tract until it is excreted from the bowels, or from the lungs and the
kidneys, or deposited in the body as bone, fat, or tissue.</p>


<p class="p2">SECOND&mdash;THE GENERATION OF HEAT AND
ENERGY</p>

<p>The second function, or rather group of functions to be considered in the study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of metabolism is the generation of heat and energy. If the reader will
recall what was said in Lesson II, regarding the production of heat by
the process of oxidation, he can more clearly comprehend the method by
which heat is produced in the animal body. However, as heat is only
one form or expression of energy, these two subjects&mdash;heat and
energy&mdash;should be considered together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat and energy produced by oxidation</div>

<p>The production of heat and energy in the body occurs almost entirely
through the oxidation of food. All three classes of foods, namely
proteids, carbohydrates, and fats can be oxidized to produce heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat, a measure of energy</div>

<p>Energy may be mechanical, chemical, electrical, or thermal. The
conservation of energy, which is one of the fundamental laws of
science, teaches that no energy can be lost, but can only be changed
into other forms. This being true, and because all energy can be
changed into heat, we use heat as a measure of energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "calory," a unit of heat</div>

<p>The unit of heat, and consequently of energy, that is used by
scientists is the "calory," which is the amount of heat required to
raise the temperature of one thousand grams of water one degree on
the centigrade thermometer scale. The energy in food is measured in
calories, as will be learned from the explanation given in the lesson
entitled "Vieno System of Food Measurement."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberation of energy through metabolism</div>

<p>The Vieno is merely a unit especially convenient in measuring
the energy in food. In order that this energy may be drawn upon or
liberated in the body, it is necessary for the food to pass through the
process of metabolism, as heretofore described.</p>


<p class="p2">THE MEASURE OF HUMAN ENERGY</p>

<p>Food may be considered as a store-house of latent or potential
energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Intake and outgo of energy accurately determined</div>

<p>Because of the law, the conservation of energy, which shows that no
energy in the universe can be lost, it is possible to study, with great
accuracy, the energy produced in, and given off by, the human body.</p>

<p>The method by which energy is measured in accurate scientific
experiments is by means of a device called the respiratory
calorimeter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How energy is measured</div>

<p>This device is a small room, the walls of which are impervious to
the transmission of both heat and air. In this room a man or an animal
may be kept for a period of several days. The air breathed, the food
eaten, the body-heat given off, the waste-products excreted, and the
mechanical work done, are all measured with the greatest scientific
accuracy. Many interesting results have been obtained from the
investigations conducted with this wonderful scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
device. These experiments will not be given in detail in this work, but
it might be remarked that experiments within the respiratory calorimeter
have proved absolutely that the law of "the conservation of energy" works
in the human body in the same manner as in the scientist's laboratory.
Moreover, such experiments have confirmed the results of the oxidation
of various foods in the laboratory, and have given us data from which to
compute the stored energy in various food substances. It has thus been
<span class="sidenote">Energy yielded from one gram each of proteids,
carbohydrates and fats</span> found that the amount of energy yielded
to the body from one gram of proteid is 4.1 calories, and from one gram
of carbohydrates 4.1 calories, while one gram of fat oxidized in the
body yields 9.3 calories, which is more than twice that yielded by the
proteids and the carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Since it has been proved that the laws established in the laboratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
also apply to the human body, it is not necessary to conduct expensive
experiments upon <span class="sidenote">Simple method of finding number
of calories in any food</span> the human subject in order to ascertain
the amount of energy in some new food. The food may be analyzed
chemically, and the energy computed according to the above figures,
or a sample of the food may be burned with an oxidizing agent in the
laboratory, and the heat measured. This latter process consists simply of
oxidizing a gram of the food in a closed steel cylinder which is immersed
in a known amount of water at a known temperature. The increase in the
temperature of the water, multiplied by the weight of the water in grams,
gives the number of calories contained in the substance tested.</p>


<p class="p2">METABOLISM OF CARBOHYDRATES</p>

<div class="sidenote">Products formed in the body from digested carbohydrates</div>

<p>The products produced by the digestion of carbohydrates are absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
from the alimentary canal in the form of glucose and smaller quantities
of levulose, and acetic, butyric and lactic acids. This glucose passes
into the blood-vessels of the intestines. These blood-vessels unite to
form the portal vein which supplies blood to the liver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversion of glucose into glycogen</div>

<p>The chief function of the liver is to regulate the sugar contained
in the blood. The liver converts this glucose into glycogen and also
acts as a reservoir in which carbohydrates are stored in the form
of glycogen until needed by the body. From this glycogen, glucose,
or blood-sugar, is again produced when the consumption from the
circulation is greater than the supply. Moreover, the liver possesses
the power to produce glucose when no carbohydrates are eaten, as
glucose can be produced from proteids. The percentage of glucose in the
blood remains, or should remain about level,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
averaging .15 of 1 per cent. It may seem odd at first that the quantity
<span class="sidenote">Percentage of glucose in blood</span> of glucose
in the blood remains so nearly level, when the quantity absorbed from the
digestive organs, and that utilized in work, is so variable. The control
of sugar in the blood is of very great importance in the body-metabolism
or life-processes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uses of glucose in the body</div>

<p>The chief use of glucose, and of other forms of digested
carbohydrates is in the formation of heat and energy. Glucose is
oxidized chiefly in the muscles, producing carbon dioxid, water, and
some lactic acid. Another function of glucose in the blood is to build
up or form fat. Fat is a form of stored food which is not so readily
available for use as are glycogen and glucose.</p>

<p>To use a homely figure of comparison, the energy-producing
substances of the human body&mdash;glucose, glycogen, and fat&mdash;may
be compared to the movement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
merchandise in ordinary commerce. We could say that the glucose of
the blood is as merchandise in the hands of the people, ready to be
consumed. The glycogen of the liver would represent goods in the hands
of the retailer, while the fat which is stored in larger quantities
would be represented by merchandise in warehouses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fat produced from carbohydrates</div>

<p>Many interesting experiments have been conducted to prove that fat
can be produced from carbohydrates. For instance, during a given period
of time a pig was fed daily upon food containing half a pound of fat,
and gained during the period nine pounds of fat. Such facts prove
beyond all possibility of doubt that carbohydrates are converted into
fat in the animal body.</p>


<p class="p2">METABOLISM OF FAT</p>

<p>Fat, when absorbed from the digestive tract, is in the form of fatty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
acids and glycerin, but immediately recombines into its original form
after it has passed through the intestinal walls. This fat then enters
the lacteals, which unite to form the thoracic duct. This duct or tube
empties its contents into one of the large veins near the heart, whence
it is distributed throughout the body. The fat of the blood is not
regulated to a definite amount, like the sugar content. After a meal,
very heavy in fat, the blood for a time is whitish in appearance, due
to the numerous minute globules of fat taken into the circulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Body-fat may be absorbed directly from food</div>

<p>The fat of the body may be deposited directly from food-fat. This
can be verified if an animal that has been starved until its own body
has been greatly reduced, be fed upon some particular form of fat. The
fat immediately deposited will then have the peculiar characteristics
of the fat taken with the food. Thus a starved dog that has been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a heavy diet of tallow will deposit fat which will contain a large
quantity of stearin and palmitin, and consequently have a higher
melting point than normal dog fat. Ordinary animal fat, as has been
shown in Lesson IV, is composed of various fats, each of which is a
distinct chemical compound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human fat not identical with food-fat</div>

<p>The distinction between tallow, lard, olive-oil, and human fat,
is chiefly due to the various portions of stearin, and olein, which
composes the mixed fat. In normal cases, where fat is deposited at
the usual rate, the body-fat is of uniform composition regardless of
the food-fats. The reason human fat is not identical with food-fat is
because the body has selective power in depositing these fats. Thus,
if the sole source of fat which a man takes in his food is tallow,
the fat-depositing cells in the human body would refuse a certain
proportion of the stearin, depositing a larger percentage of olein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
thus giving a softer or more liquid fat than that which was supplied in
the food. The excess of stearin would be consumed in the production of
heat and muscular energy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why exercise reduces obesity</div>

<p>When the consumption of glucose in the muscles becomes greater
than the supply available in the blood, and from the glycogen of the
liver, body-fat must be consumed. This explains why exercise reduces
obesity.</p>

<p>The method of preventing, or of curing, obesity, is a double
process:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 The diet is selected and proportioned so as to reduce the amount
of ingested fat</p>

<p>2 Exercises are prescribed to consume the fat that has
accumulated</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Fat, the chief source of energy</div>

<p>Of all food materials, fat is the least changed by digestion, and has
no particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> function in the life-processes except
the storing of energy. More body-energy can be stored in a pound of
body-fat than in any other form.</p>

<p>From these deductions it is evident that carbohydrates and fats
perform very similar functions within the body, and can, in a large
measure, replace each other as a source of heat and muscular energy.</p>


<p class="p2">METABOLISM OF PROTEIDS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of proteid or nitrogenous foods</div>

<p>Owing to the fact that the tissues of the normal body are
constructed chiefly from proteids, the metabolism of proteids or
nitrogenous foods is of very great importance. When we realize the fact
that muscle, blood, brain, nerves, cartilage, tendons, the various
internal organs and the tougher material of the skeleton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
are only various forms of proteid material, and must contain their
proportions of available or organic nitrogen, we can understand why
nitrogenous foods form a distinct class that must be considered by
themselves. Only the mineral deposits of the bones and the teeth, and
the globules of fat that are deposited as a source of stored energy
represent the nitrogen-free class of substances within the animal
body.</p>


<p class="p2">THE USE OF PROTEIDS IN THE BODY</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proteids as tissue-builders</div>

<p>The first use Nature makes of proteids in the body is in the actual
adding to or increasing of body-tissue. When an emaciated young man
from the city goes to work on a farm and gains twenty pounds, the
cells of his muscles have actually increased in size and number. This
requires proteids, which can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
obtained only from the nitrogenous material in food. The growth during
early life is due to an actual increase in the size of all the organs
of the body, and is merely an accumulation of proteid substance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proteids form the nitrogenous part of the body</div>

<p>The second use of proteids, and the one which, in matured life, is
of more importance than those already referred to, is in the formation
of the various nitrogenous products which are produced in connection
with the different processes of the body and which are destroyed by
the function of life. For example, the pepsin of the gastric juice is
a nitrogenous substance which can be formed only from proteids. All
digestive enzyms and other substances in the muscles, nerves, and in
the various organs throughout the body are of a nitrogenous nature,
and in their formation and use a certain amount of proteid material is
consumed. When the digestive enzyms are formed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
proteids, they consume more than their own weight of proteid
material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proteids replace worn-out cells</div>

<p>The third form in which proteids may be consumed in the body is in
the actual replacement of worn-out cells. The skin, the hair, and the
mucous or lining membranes of the body-cavities are constantly being
cast off on the external surface, new cells being formed underneath.
When cells within the interior of the body have become injured, or have
passed their usefulness, they are removed by the phagocytes or white
blood-corpuscles, and must be replaced by other cells. In the case
of bacterial infections, as tumors, boils, or contagious dis-eases,
the bacteria feed upon the proteids of the blood. The white blood
corpuscles are destroyed in the conflict, or effort to remove the
intruders, and all these substances must be replaced by proteids from
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">THE ACTION AND THE COMPOSITION OF
PROTEIDS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determination of income and outgo of nitrogen</div>

<p>The gain or loss of body-proteids is indicated by the gain or loss
of nitrogen. The income of nitrogen can be ascertained by analyzing
the food. The outgo of nitrogen is computed by analyzing the products
excreted from the body. If the body at the beginning and at the end of
an experimental period is carefully watched, and the income and the
outgo of nitrogen determined, we can compute the amount of gain in the
body that is nitrogenous tissue. The other gain or loss of body-weight
must be fat. These calculations cannot be made exact, owing to the
amount of food and water that may be in the digestive organs at the
time the various weighings are made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why proteids are converted into peptones</div>

<p>We have learned that in the digestive tract foods are converted
into a soluble form of proteid known as peptone. The purpose of this
conversion and the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
subdivisions of food produced by the various digestive juices are to
reduce it to a form which will readily pass through the walls of the
alimentary canal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nitrogen and urea</div>

<p>This is all that was known about proteid metabolism until within
very recent years. The older scientists followed proteid digestion
until the soluble peptone stage was reached, at which point all track
was lost of the chemical changes and processes until the nitrogen was
again excreted by the kidneys in the form of urea.</p>

<p>No scientist attempted to explain how the radically different
proteids, such as egg-albumin, milk-casein, and wheat-glutin could
appear in the body as blood-globulin, brain-lecithin, or as a myosis of
the muscles.</p>

<p>The history of all these investigations cannot be fully explained
here, but the discussion must be confined to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which actually takes place in the metabolism of proteids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition of proteids</div>

<p>Proteids, as the student will remember, contain carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen, and sometimes small quantities of sulfur,
phosphorus, or iron. These forms of proteids are now known to be
chemically changed, by the digestive enzyms of the intestines, into
simpler compounds containing these same elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How proteids may form body-fats</div>

<p>These simple nitrogenous substances pass into the liver. Just as
the liver regulates the supply of blood sugar, so it regulates the
supply of nitrogenous compounds in the blood. A certain amount of
proteid-forming material is passed through the liver, and goes on to
perform the various functions for which proteid is utilized in the
body. All nitrogenous material in excess of the amount required by the
body is secreted by the liver, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the nitrogen, together with a portion of the carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, is split off, forming urea, which is excreted by the kidneys.
The remainder of the proteid substance, having been robbed of its
nitrogen, is now essentially the same as carbohydrates, and goes to
form glucose or blood-sugar, which may in turn form body-fats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excess of proteids harmful</div>

<p>In the light of this explanation, we can understand several things
already mentioned. It has been stated that proteid is the most
essential food material of the body because it alone contains the
nitrogenous compounds from which the body-tissues, and the chemical
enzyms which control all living processes, can be constructed. But we
now see that as important as is a supply of proteid materials, any
excess above the body-needs is immediately turned into glucose and
urea. The glucose, though useful to the body, could be taken in a
simpler and less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
expensive form, while the urea is a waste-product, harmful to life, and
must be immediately excreted by the kidneys.</p>

<p>The nitrogen that is actually used in the body serves a different
purpose from that which is split off from the excessive proteid taken
as food. The food proteid is simply split by the chemical addition of
water, much the same as starch and other carbohydrates are changed into
glucose. The proteid that is really used by the body is oxidized, and
is excreted by the kidneys chiefly in the form of creatinin and uric
acid.</p>


<p class="p2">FOOD STANDARDS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incorrect interpretation of scientific data</div>

<p>The term "dietary standard," as it has been applied in the past,
means the quantity of the several nutrients that should be taken by the
human body under its varying conditions. During the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
twenty-five years, many investigations have been made in this country,
Europe, and Japan, regarding the amount of foods consumed by various
groups of people. All the facts gathered, which include more or less
accurate records of the foods eaten by many thousands of individuals
under all circumstances and conditions of life, are invaluable
scientific data, but the interpretation that has been placed upon these
interesting observations is one of the most conspicuous blunders made
by the scientific world. Whether this criticism should fall wholly upon
the men of science, who made these investigations, or upon the people
who misinterpreted their meaning, is perhaps an open question; but the
fact remains that from the general teachings in physiologies, and from
popular bulletins published by the National Government, very incorrect
ideas have been widely spread respecting the amount of food required to
maintain life and health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Data of foods consumed daily by various people</div>

<p>In order to give the reader some idea of the results obtained, when
data is kept each twenty-four hours, of the amount of food consumed
by various people on the conventional diets of civilization, I will
select at random some of the results that have been recorded in these
investigations, and will give in the Vieno System the approximate
results. (See "Vieno System of Food Measurement," Vol. III, p. 639):</p>

approximated. The standards published by the Government, computed by
Prof. Atwater, and commonly known as the Atwater standards, are as
follows, expressed in vienos:</p>

<p>The Atwater standard for women is estimated to be four-fifths of the
amount of food required for a man under similar conditions.</p>

<p>It is generally recognized by investigators that these so-called
standards are faulty, but by mutual agreement it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
seems that they have been accepted as the best that could be given.
<span class="sidenote">Faulty standards due to inexperience</span>
They lack accuracy because the men who prepared them lacked experience.
Accuracy can come only from experience gained in the practical work;
that is, in prescribing food, and combinations of food, for people
under all the varying conditions of age, climate, and activity, and
having these people report, at stated periods, the results of their
dietetic prescriptions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of correct dietary standards</div>

<p>The average person eats what is set before him and asks no question
about nitrogen and energy; nevertheless, advice so universally
distributed as the Government Dietary Standards must exert much
influence and have a considerable effect upon the habits of the people.
Obviously the correctness of these standards is of vital importance to
the health and the welfare of the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">What a dietary standard should contain</div>

<p>A dietary standard should tell the quantity and the proportion of
food required to keep the human body in its very best working state.
The great error committed by the man who planned the above-named
standards has been that he assumed that an average of what a man
<em>does</em> eat is a criterion of what he <em>should</em> eat in
order to maintain the best mental and physical condition. A greater
error could not have been made. <em>Our feeding instincts have been
lost in the chaos of civilization.</em> Both our appetite and our
food have been perverted. We have been trained to want or to crave
intoxicants, stimulants and sedatives; we have learned to relish
things that have no food value, and we have grown to dislike the best
food that nature produces, and to accept many of her worst. Dietary
standards, therefore, made up from the conventional eating habits of
the people, merely endorse their errors and pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
them on to future generations. The work, therefore, of the true
scientist is to point out these errors and to prescribe a remedy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">We are creatures of many (bad) habits</div>

<p>Man is a creature of habits, and civilized man is a creature of a
great many bad habits. The argument that the average amount of food
eaten is the amount that should be eaten falls under suspicion at once
when we consider the fact that by a similar line of reasoning we could
prove that the use of tobacco is necessary because the majority of men
use it, or that slender waists are necessary to good social standing
because a few million women so consider them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American prosperity not due to rich diet</div>

<p>The idea has been spread far and wide that the diet of the American
working man, which is the richest in proteid of any race in the world,
is responsible for the greater economic thrift of the American people.
It is a matter of history that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
rich diet is always associated with prosperity, but the theory that the
diet is the cause of the prosperity is an egregious error. Meat and
rich foods gain a hold upon the appetite as do alcohol and narcotics.
When nations or cities become wealthy, intemperance in eating is the
usual result, but this in nowise indicates that a heavy consumption
of food is the cause of a nation's greatness. History recites many
instances of the rise and growth of a people to power and prosperity,
together with the consequent adoption of excessive and luxurious
habits of eating and drinking, only to be followed by physical
deterioration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excessive food a waste of energy</div>

<p>It is not the quantity of food that is eaten, but the quantity of
food that will give the greatest vitality and capacity to do things,
that should determine our dietary standards. It is reasonable to assume
that this amount would be the least quantity that would maintain
activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> without using up the food material stored
in the body. All food taken in excess of the amount actually required
must be cast from the body at a tremendous expense of energy. To
do a given amount of work, or to add one pound of muscular tissue
to the body, requires a definite quantity of energy-yielding or
tissue-building material, but if more food is taken than the body can
use, the excess ferments in the stomach and in the alimentary tract,
producing poisonous products which are absorbed into the blood. These
poisonous products cause a great number of human ills. The process of
eliminating these poisons we call "dis-ease."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Former dietary standards cut in half</div>

<p>The assumption that the correct amount of food that should
be taken by the body is the least quantity that will maintain
normal body-functions, has been amply proved by recent scientific
investigations to be correct. Many years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
experience on the part of the writer have shown that to make food
remedial and curative, the old dietary standards must be, roughly
speaking, cut in half.</p>


<p class="p2">TRUE FOOD REQUIREMENTS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quantity of food required for various occupations</div>

<p>The degree of energy required by the body depends very largely
upon the amount of work or activity it undergoes, hence the amount of
food required to supply this activity cannot be accurately prescribed
when the degree of required energy is unknown. However, there is a
certain amount of work performed by the beating of the heart and in
the maintenance of body-heat which can be fairly well estimated. The
quantity of energy-yielding food required, each twenty-four hours, for
the maintenance of the activities of life is about one vieno for every
ten pounds of body-weight. For a man at steady muscular work, such as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
carpenter or a farmer, this quantity should be about doubled. The
quantity required by a man of sedentary habits, but who takes regular
exercise for an hour or two each day, is about half way between these
two amounts. Thus, a man weighing one hundred forty pounds would
require one and one-half vienos for each ten pounds, or twenty-one
vienos of food each day. These weights apply only to people of normal
flesh, who desire neither to gain nor to lose.</p>

<p>The fact that either fat or carbohydrates can be used as a source of
muscular energy may be taken advantage of in prescribing dietaries for
persons whose digestive organs are so impaired that they cannot digest
a normal quantity of either of these nutrients, but who could digest
a small quantity of either. This does not mean, however, that the
proportion of fat and of carbohydrates in the food can be disregarded.
The digestive processes involved are radically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
different, hence a suitable proportion of carbohydrates and fats should
always be maintained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportion of fat required under ordinary
conditions</div>

<p>With a view to guiding in a general way those who wish to adopt a
standard of diet for ordinary use, and who consult tables in which
fats and carbohydrates are listed separately, I might state that
the fat should form about one-eighth the total source of energy, or
one-sixteenth the weight of all water-free (solid) food eaten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fallacy of lean meat producing muscle</div>

<p>Until forty years ago the idea was held by scientists, and is still
a matter of popular belief, that nitrogenous foods are the sole source
of all muscular energy. This is quite a natural assumption. Lean meat
is muscle. If a man eats the muscle of another animal, by the primitive
process of reasoning, he should acquire muscle. This belief among
people who are not acquainted with physiological chemistry is almost
universal, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
facts are, the man who eats the muscle of an ox for the purpose of
adding strength to his own biceps is acting no more wisely than the
college boy who takes calf's brain for breakfast the day before
examination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nitrogenous foods not a source of muscular energy</div>

<p>The fact that nitrogenous foods are not a source of muscular energy
has been repeatedly proved by experiments on man and animals too
numerous to relate here. The sugar and the fat in the blood are taken
into the muscle-cells, and there unite with the oxygen brought from the
lungs, producing energy. When the body is fed upon proteids lacking a
sufficient quantity of other food elements, a portion of this proteid
is converted into glucose or sugar, which maintains body-heat and
energy. This is what happens in the case of carnivorous animals that
have excretory organs especially adapted to the converting and the
eliminating of useless or surplus products.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Small amount of proteid matter required by animals</div>

<p>It has been proved that dogs are capable of living for an indefinite
period of time upon a diet containing only a small proportion of
proteid matter, while maintaining health and increasing in weight.
Thus we see that even carnivorous animals require, for the maintenance
of the body-functions, a comparatively small amount of nitrogenous
material. Their strength and heat-forming elements can be secured
from carbohydrates and fats, probably to their actual benefit. It is
interesting to note, however, that dogs as a general rule cannot live
and thrive on a vegetable diet; a certain amount of animal proteids
seems indispensable. The same principle applies to other carnivorous
animals. Even ducks and chickens need a small percentage of animal
proteids in order to properly thrive and develop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions governing quantity of nitrogen</div>

<p>In order to maintain good health, every person requires a certain amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of nitrogen, the quantity being governed by activity, exposure, age,
and temperature of environment. The growing youth needs nitrogen to
supply material for the tissue growth of his body; an emaciated person
who wishes to increase weight, a person recovering from illness, or a
man who is constantly performing strenuous work, would all require a
generous quantity of nitrogenous food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lowest daily amount of nitrogen required</div>

<p>The lowest possible nitrogen requirement for one of normal weight
has been determined by various methods to be from 40 to 60 decigrams
per day. This quantity, however, is the actual amount that is used in
the body-processes, and should be increased according to activity or
exposure to the open air.</p>

<p>From the results of numerous experiments under normal activity, the
quantity of nitrogenous food estimated to maintain the best bodily
condition is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
three-fourths of a decigram for each pound of body-weight; less than
<span class="sidenote">Amount of nitrogen required by the body</span>
one-half of a decigram per pound of body-weight would cause nitrogen
starvation, while more than one decigram per pound, except in the cases
just mentioned, would result only in thrusting needless work upon the
liver and the kidneys, whose duties are to guard the body against the
results of incorrect eating. There are certain conditions under which
this amount of nitrogen may be exceeded in order to gain definite and
specific purposes, but in such cases the nature of the proteid is
of great importance. In certain occupations, for instance sedative
labor, the most soluble proteids, such as egg albumin (white of eggs),
milk, and green peas and beans should be selected; while in cases of
heavy manual labor, the heavier proteids, such as nuts, cheese, dried
legumes, fish and fowl should be selected.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_VII" id="LESSON_VII">LESSON VII</a></h2>

<p class="p1">FOODS OF ANIMAL ORIGIN</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>An intelligent discussion of this lesson leads us directly into a
subject commonly known as "vegetarianism." The question whether man
should eat the flesh of animals is especially fascinating for those
who give attention to the food they eat. There are many standpoints,
however, from which the subject of vegetarianism may be discussed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of religion on man's food</div>

<p>In the first place, nearly all religious teachings that have wielded
such a powerful influence over the civilization and destiny of men,
have laid some restrictions upon the flesh-eating habit. Some religions
require man to refrain from all animal products, while
others interdict only the flesh of certain animals. Coupled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with man's world-wide search for food, these religious teachings have
played a conspicuous part in the question of human nutrition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vegetarianism from animal's standpoint</div>

<p>The second phase of the question that merits attention is the
moral side, or vegetarianism from the animal's standpoint; in other
words, the cruelty involved in the slaughter of our dumb friends and
helpers, for whose presence here we are largely responsible. That the
practises and customs which train humanity in cruelty toward animal
life, are to be discouraged, cannot well be disputed, but this phase
of vegetarianism is one which is somewhat without the realm of applied
food chemistry, hence is mentioned only as a factor in the general
discussion.</p>



<p>I will now consider vegetarianism from the standpoint of true food
science, or the welfare of the physical man. It will be observed that
in the lesson entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
"Evolution of Man," one of the first considerations taken up is the
scientific <span class="sidenote">Vegetarianism from standpoint of scientific
living</span> discussion of man's natural adaptation to the use of flesh
foods. By natural adaptation I mean Nature's evolutionary plan of fitting
the physiological organism to the food man is able to procure. The
organism of man will, to a certain extent, adapt itself to a given diet
within the brief period of one generation, just as, in the long ages of
evolution, the digestive organs of any species of animal become adapted
to such diet as may be procured. Thus it is of especial importance for
us to know the diet of primitive man at a time before his intellectual
resourcefulness made it possible for him to gather his bill of fare from
the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>The diet of our related anthropoid apes, of every primitive savage
tribe, and of our ancestors, indications of which have been found in
fossils and caves&mdash;all three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
throw light upon the subject. The consensus of these various studies
indicates <span class="sidenote">Primitive diet of man</span> that the
original or natural diet of man was one drawn chiefly from the vegetable
kingdom, but not entirely so. Fruits, nuts, green vegetables, edible
foliage, tubers or roots were all included in man's primitive diet. The
foods of animal origin were varied, and consisted of such articles as
birds, eggs, shell-fish, many insects, and other forms of lower animal
life, of which our modern habit of eating frogs' legs, eels, escargots
(snails), etc., is merely an inheritance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why flesh-eating is unnecessary</div>

<p>Since the digestive, the assimilative, and the excretory organs of
man have been constructed from, and adapted to, the use of vegetables,
it is obvious that the flesh of animals is unnecessary, especially in
view of the fact that there is nothing in flesh that cannot be secured
from the vegetable world in its best and purest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
form. Man's primitive diet does not prove that he is by nature a
vegetarian, as is the cow, and therefore entirely unsuited to digest
any material of animal origin. The anatomy of man's teeth and of
his digestive organs, however, indicates that he is by nature a
vegetarian, and that his digestive organs are prepared to dissolve
and to assimilate a diet that is somewhat more bulky than that of
carnivorous animals, but, on the other hand, less bulky than the diet
of animals which subsist wholly upon succulent plants, as do the purely
herbivorous species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Food problem of the Aryan races</div>

<p>Man is by nature a tropical animal, and so long as his habitat was
confined to that section, he could live from the prodigality of Nature,
but when he began his early migration northward, his food was the
greatest problem he had to solve. He was often forced to choose between
eating the flesh of animals and death from starvation. It was this
fierce struggle for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
food, not the character of his food, which exercised both the physical
and the mental powers, and caused the Aryan or northern races to think,
and therefore to develop into people so much superior to their tropical
brothers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forced to think and to work, man became civilized</div>

<p>The defenders of flesh food often point to the fact that
flesh-eating people have achieved the highest civilization. Man's
superior achievement in northern countries can no more be credited to
flesh-eating than to the wearing of fur caps or leather boots. To meet
the exigencies of his environment, he was forced to think and to work,
and thinking and working developed the brain and laid the foundation
for his present stage of civilization.</p>

<p>Another reason for the early habit of flesh-eating is found in the
fact that in order to sustain the required amount of body-heat in cold
climates, a liberal consumption of fat was necessary. Vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
fats not being available, his only source of supply was from the
body-fat of animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of meat unscientific</div>

<p>Aside from fat, protein is the only nutritive element meat contains.
With the variety of vegetable and butter-fats, and vegetable proteids
available in this age, supplemented by our knowledge of chemistry as
a guide in their use, the consumption of flesh as an article of human
food is entirely unscientific and wholly without reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life MAY BE maintained by meat</div>

<p>A diet composed exclusively of flesh contains fat and nitrogenous
compounds only. These two classes of foods can, of course, maintain
life, as was explained in our sixth lesson, as proteid is capable of
forming blood, sugar, and body-fat. The fact, however, that the proteid
or the fat of meat can be made to fill, in the physiological economy,
the place naturally supplied by the carbohydrate materials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
vegetable food, does not prove that such a diet is without its harmful
effects. The living body has many wonderful provisions whereby life
is maintained under unfavorable influences. Just as a blind person
develops a sense of touch which in a way acts as a substitute for
sight, so the ability of the body to convert either proteids or fats
into sugar, may be utilized in cases of emergency, but the using of
this emergency or substitute function of the body cannot develop and
energize the human machine as well or as perfectly as can a naturally
balanced diet. The fact that some people exist largely upon a meat
diet does not prove that this is without its handicapping and evil
influences, any more than the use of alcohol and tobacco proves that
man is benefited by indulging in intoxicants and sedative poisons.</p>

<p>That flesh-eating is largely responsible for the universal desire
among civilized people for some form of stimulant has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
ceased to be questioned by those who have been placed in a position
to make experiments&mdash;the source from <span class="sidenote">Flesh-eating produces appetite
for stimulants</span> which all real knowledge
is obtained. These conclusions were first forced upon the writer by
noticing the gradual decline of appetite for coffee and tobacco in his
own case, when he began to subsist upon natural foods. With this hint
no opportunity was lost, among the thousands of patients he treated,
to observe the effects and get at the truth. If only one or two people
had completely lost their appetite for all forms of stimulation,
after following a natural food regimen, it might have revealed only
an idiosyncrasy. When a dozen undergo the same treatment, with the
same results, it leaves but little doubt that the theory may be true,
but when many hundreds give the same testimony, through a period of a
dozen years' practise, it reveals a truth that cannot be consistently
doubted. Such experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
proves beyond doubt that flesh-eating supports and perpetuates the
habit of taking distilled and ardent liquors, tobacco, tea, and coffee,
and the numerous drugs which, altogether, have done the human race more
harm; dethroned more intelligence; sapped from the human economy more
vitality; ruined more homes; made more widows and orphans; changed
more natural virtue into vice, and caused more sorrow and tears, more
failure and fears, than all other agencies of destruction combined.</p>

<p>Since fats and proteids are the only nutrients supplied by flesh
foods, we may well ask, "Is meat the best source from which these
elements may be secured?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flesh food contains unexcreted waste matter</div>

<p>The proteid substance of meat includes all the edible portion of a
carcass except the fat. The proteid of meat is more easily and more
rapidly digested than the proteid of vegetables. Notwithstanding this
fact, there are serious objections to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the use of meat as a source of nitrogen. All flesh food contains the
unexcreted waste matter of the slaughtered animal. When the process
of metabolism that is continually going on during life is suddenly
arrested by death, the effete and decomposing cells, and the partly
oxidized waste-products which are still held in the muscle-tissues,
are left in the flesh of the dead animal, hence these poisons must be
consumed by the flesh-eater in order to secure the meat proteids and
fats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Body-poisons generated by fear</div>

<p>It is now a matter of common knowledge among scientists, and among
the more advanced school of pathologists, that the usual conditions
under which animals are slain change the chemical constituents of the
blood-serum, charging it with a form of poison that to the chemist is
as yet unknown, but the presence and the potency of which is attested
by its effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The method of slaughtering animals in the great abattoirs is
especially conducive to the generation of these poisons. The condemned
herd is driven to the place of slaughter and killed, one at a time,
in plain view of their fellows. These animals are very intelligent
and possess remarkable senses of danger. They are as conscious of
approaching death as the creature who takes their lives, hence the
amount of poisons generated in their bodies is measured by the time
they are kept in waiting. Most animals when killed labor under these
conditions, and that these mental states render their flesh entirely
unfit for human nutrition can no longer be questioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mother's milk poisoned by fear or anger</div>

<p>We find fragments of evidence supporting this theory in the fact
that Nature's perfect food&mdash;the milk of a nursing animal, or of
a nursing mother&mdash;can be changed in an instant into a poison by
sudden fright, anger, or fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meat a source of autointoxication</div>

<p>Thus we see that in eating meat, we are eating animal waste-material
similar to that thrown off through our own body-cells. The waste
material in meat being soluble, passes through the walls of our
digestive organs, and enters the circulation, where it is added to
similar poisons which are constantly being produced within our own
bodies. It is the universal law of animal cell-growth that the waste
matter of the cell acts as its own poison. When bacteria, growing in
a solution of sugar, have excreted alcohol until it forms a certain
percentage of the total contents, their activity ceases&mdash;they die
from poisons thrown off from their own bodies. This is the reason that
liquids containing a high percentage of alcohol must be distilled, and
cannot be brewed. It is obvious, therefore, that in the consumption of
flesh, we are adding to our bodies the poisons that are residual in the
body of other animals, and are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
therefore, approaching the conditions under which bacteria kill
themselves by autointoxication or self-poisoning.</p>

<p>Plants utilize the carbon dioxid excreted by the animal, and the
excrement of animals is in turn used to fertilize our fields. Although
one form of life may utilize what is excreted by another form of life,
the living thing that cannot get away from the excreted matter of its
own activity is poisoned thereby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flesh food burdens the excretory organs</div>

<p>The flesh of animals whose physiological processes are almost
identical with our own, containing as it does waste-products that
have not yet been excreted, must, when taken into the human body, add
extra burdens to our excretory organs which are usually burdened with
all they can do. Carnivorous animals are especially provided with an
excretory system capable of taking care of such matter, but it is
unreasonable to expect the excretory organs of man, which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
adapted to such a purpose, to throw off, in addition to the regular
body-poisons, similar decomposing products of other animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flesh-eating will disappear as science advances</div>

<p>It is true that flesh will support, and has supported what is
commonly regarded as a high form of anthropoid life (man), but not
having the natural standard from which to measure, we do not know how
much better the opposite course would have been, or just how much
longer one would live under a perfectly natural regimen. The effects
of flesh-eating have not been definitely known until recent years, but
is now acknowledged by the most advanced authorities to be one of the
greatest errors of civilized people, and will, within a few years,
disappear from the catalog of human habits, when the great masses of
people are made familiar with the chemistry of food, and how to secure
vegetable instead of animal proteids and fats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">MEAT</p>

<p>Meat, in the sense the word is here
used, includes beef, mutton, pork, and an
occasional allowance of wild game. Chemically
considered, meat may be divided
into two classes, namely (1) flesh or lean
meat, and (2) animal fats. The former
will be first considered.</p>


<p class="p2">1 FLESH OR LEAN MEAT</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition of lean meat</div>

<p>Lean meat is composed of the muscles of the animal. Approximately
it is 70 per cent water, 20 per cent protein, and 10 per cent fat. The
protein is composed of connective tissue, which is a tough, fibrous
substance that forms tendons, and holds the muscle-cells in place.
Chemically, connective tissue is formed of albuminoids, which were
discussed in Lesson IV. These substances are somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
difficult to digest, and are not of very great importance in the
human body, as they cannot take the place of true proteid in
tissue-formation.</p>

<p>The percentage of connective tissue in flesh depends upon the cut of
the meat. As every housewife knows, the cheapest cuts of meat contain a
larger amount of this material.</p>

<p>The gelatin of commerce is a manufactured product derived from the
connective tissue of animals.</p>

<p>Other forms of protein are globulin and myosin, which form the
actual muscle-substance. These elements form perhaps three-fourths of
the entire proteid of the animal, and are the most valuable substances
of flesh food. A very small portion of meat proteids is formed by the
free albumins of the blood, which are mechanically retained in the
muscle-cells, the purpose of which is the nourishment of the animal,
and therefore are not unwholesome as food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meat extractives and their composition</div>

<p>Another class of nitrogenous substances found in flesh foods is
called meat extractives. Though they exist only in quantities of from
one to two per cent of the weight of the flesh, they are the most
interesting from the standpoint of chemistry, because they are found
only in flesh foods, and are products only of cell life, hence not
wholesome as food. They are composed of urea, uric acid, creatin,
etc., and are similar or identical to the waste-products of human cell
metabolism. The amount of these substances contained in flesh depends
upon the condition of the animal at the time of slaughter, being much
greater in animals slain after the chase, or laboring under fear or
abuse.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of the different cuts of meat does not vary
greatly, except in a greater or less per cent of fat, and no chemical
calculation can compute this accurately, as the fat in every cut of
meat varies widely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prejudice against the hog</div>

<p>Beef and mutton are comparatively the same in both nutritive value
and popularity, but the use of pork has been generally condemned the
world over. The reason for this is probably explained by prejudices
of tradition and religion, rather than by scientific or hygienic
knowledge. The prejudice against swine because of the filthy habits
of the animal is more a matter of sentiment than of science. It is
sometimes the custom among farmers to confine hogs in a pen, and to
feed them upon swill and garbage. This makes of the animal a filthy
creature. However, when left in the open fields or woods, they are
as cleanly in their habits as any of their brother animals. Corn and
alfalfa-fed pork is equally as wholesome as beef or mutton, when
prepared in a similar manner, and eaten in temperate quantities, while
the hog fattened upon acorns and herbs, in his native habitat (the
woods), is much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
healthy, and his flesh really superior to most of his brother
animals.</p>


<p class="p2">2 ANIMAL FATS</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal fats not a necessity</div>

<p>The use of animal fats as food is a very ancient custom, especially
among the northern tribes. This custom was once justified owing to
the necessity for the consumption of a liberal amount of fats in
cold countries, but in this country where our marvelous system of
international transportation places at the door of every northern home
the delicious fats from the olive orchards of Italy, France, and Spain,
the refined oil from the cottonseed, and more than a dozen varieties of
nuts, including the humble peanut, there is but little necessity for
the use of animal fats except in the form of butter and cream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chemical change in frying fats</div>

<p>Perhaps the most injurious way in which animal fats are used is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the process of frying, which is much practised in southern countries
in the preparation of other food. The chemical change which takes
place in fats, when treated in this manner, renders them exceedingly
indigestible, and almost wholly unfit for food.</p>

<p>That per cent of animal fats contained in the ordinary meat diet
is quite as wholesome as any other element of nutrition secured from
animal sources. However, with the splendid supply of vegetable fats
civilized people have to draw upon, the use of animal fats cannot be
recommended in any form except that of cream and butter, and when we
consider the expense of these by comparison with many pure vegetable
fats, our sense of ordinary economy would bid us discard them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chemical difference between animal and vegetable fats</div>

<p>The chief distinction between animal and vegetable fats is in the
proportion of olein compared with stearin and palmitin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
The proportion of the two latter fats is much greater in fats of
domestic animals than it is in the human body; this is especially so
of tallow. For this reason vegetable fats, which are of a more liquid
nature, are more desirable than those of animal origin, especially
where we wish to add fatty tissue to the body.</p>


<p class="p2">COLD STORAGE OF MEAT</p>

<p>A very small amount of the meat produced in this country at the
present time is consumed near its place of slaughter. Cold storage
plants and refrigerator cars have been constructed for the purpose
of preserving meats until they can reach their destination, and to
hold them awaiting market advances for the benefit of packers and
tradesmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decomposition of cold storage meat</div>

<p>Meat in cold storage is slowly undergoing a form of decomposition
which is evidenced by the fact that cold storage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
meat decays much more rapidly upon its removal from storage than do the
same cuts of fresh meat.</p>

<p>The process of ripening meat in rooms of varying temperatures
depends upon this form of decomposition. The natural enzyms of the
meat, and the bacteria contained therein, digest a portion of the
proteids, forming nitrogenous decomposition products, similar to the
above-mentioned meat extractives. Ripened or storage meats contain
a much larger per cent of this group of compounds than does fresh
meat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Ripened meat" a step toward decay</div>

<p>The high flavor and "peculiar rich taste" of ripened meats is
produced by these decomposition products, while the decay of the
gelatinoid or connective tissue is the primary reason for its
tenderness. There are certain species of bacteria that produce more
poisonous waste-products than others, and this occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
causes the development of ptomains in storage meat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A choice between two evils</div>

<p>The use of flesh as an article of food is fraught with many serious
and scientific objections, but the use of cold storage or ripened
animal products is to be condemned from every standpoint of hygiene.
Nevertheless, if people insist upon using flesh foods, and economical
conditions make it profitable to produce them far from their place of
consumption, cold storage methods seem inevitable. The choice between
storage meats and home-killed is, in its last analysis, a matter of
selecting the lesser of two evils.</p>


<p class="p2">CONTAGIOUS DIS-EASES AND ANIMAL FOOD</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rare beef unfit for food</div>

<p>Much has been written as to how, from dis-eased animals, human
beings have contracted contagious dis-eases, especially tuberculosis.
The risk of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> contagion has in all probability been
much exaggerated. Flesh foods are seldom taken in an uncooked form,
and dis-ease germs are usually destroyed by the sterilizing process
involved in cooking. The cooking process, however, must be very
thorough in order to destroy dis-ease germs; that is, the heat must be
sufficient to coagulate the proteids. The interior of a rare beefsteak,
such as popularly demanded by the flesh-eater, has not reached this
temperature, hence this form of meat should be condemned on this ground
if for no other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trichinosis</div>

<p>Perhaps the worst form of dis-ease contamination from fresh flesh
food is that of trichinosis. Trichinae are worm-like creatures which
have the first stage of their growth in the flesh of swine, and then
become encased in a cyst or egg-like structure, which, when taken into
the human digestive organs are revived, and the trichinae then bore
their way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the walls of the digestive organs, completing their growth in the human
muscle-tissue. Trichinosis is one of the most fatal of diseases, but
fortunately is not common. Tapeworms owe their origin to a similar
source. There are several species of tapeworms; some have their origin
in pork, and some in beef.</p>


<p class="p2">FISH</p>

<p>Under this heading I will consider fish and other sea-creatures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nutrients in fish</div>

<p>The flesh of most fish is quite free from fat, and consists almost
entirely of water and proteids. It is less concentrated than the flesh
of warm-blooded animals, averaging about 18 to 20 per cent proteids,
and 60 to 70 per cent water. The percentage of ash in fish is also
somewhat greater than in any other flesh food. The popular idea that
fish is good food for the brain originated in the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
analysis of some fish shows a considerable percentage of phosphorus,
which substance <span class="sidenote">Fish as brain food</span> is also
found in the brain. There is no reason to believe, however, that the
liberal use of fish would develop or produce an excess of brain-tissue.
Any well-balanced diet contains ample phosphorus to nourish the brain.</p>

<p>The true science of human nutrition lies in the knowledge of
selecting, combining, and proportioning food according to age, climate,
and work. When this is done, the tendency of the body is to eliminate
dis-ease and to assume normal action; this accomplished, every part of
the anatomy shares in the general improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fish superior to flesh of mammals</div>

<p>My theory advanced against the use of meat because of nitrogenous
decomposition products, holds true with fish, though in a somewhat
limited degree. The decomposition products of cold-blooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
animals are not identical with those of mammals, hence their
consumption as food does not add to the percentage of human
waste-products so directly as do other meats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oysters and clams unfit for food</div>

<p>Oysters and clams, which are generally eaten uncooked, are
recommended by many authorities as valuable sources of proteid. The
serious objection to their use, and especially uncooked, is the fact
that they are grown in the sea-water around harbor entrances which
are flooded with sewage, and hence they are likely to be contaminated
with typhoid, or similar germs. The actual food value in shell-fish is
quite small. They contain only about ten per cent of proteids, and are
scarcely worth considering as a source of nutrition.</p>


<p class="p2">POULTRY AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD</p>

<p>The objections that I have made against the use of the flesh of fish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
mammals as an article of food may also be assessed against the use of
domestic and wild fowls. There are a few special points, however, in
favor of poultry as food that are worth special consideration.</p>

<p>The production of chickens and other domestic poultry is one of the
most prolific industries in America, and is of great importance to the
general public because it is capable of being carried on in communities
too thickly settled for the economic production of beef and other
meats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poultry superior to the flesh of mammals</div>

<p>Another point to be observed in the use of poultry as food is that,
because of the ease with which every farmer and villager can keep a
flock of chickens, it is possible for him to have fresh meat produced
under the most sanitary and hygienic conditions, while if he uses meat
as food, he will be compelled to depend upon the various meat products
of unknown age and origin, secured from the general market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Another reason why the use of poultry, from a hygienic standpoint,
is less objectionable than the use of pork and beef is that the
quantity consumed is usually much smaller than the amount eaten of
these heavy-blooded meats.</p>

<p>For example: When five pounds of beefsteak is purchased in the
market, the amount consumed would be almost the full weight of the
purchase. If the money were invested in a five-pound chicken, a goodly
portion of this weight would be lost in preparing the fowl for the
table, while a still further loss would occur in the bones and in the
inedible portions, so that the actual amount of flesh consumed would
not be more than perhaps two pounds.</p>

<p>According to the old idea of economy and diet, this would be a
serious argument against the use of poultry products, but as has been
clearly proved in this course of lessons, the most serious criticism
that can be urged against the modern bill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
fare is quantity, and especially the use of meat in large quantities,
so common among the American people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Custom vs. hygiene</div>

<p>The chief reason for which meat is kept upon the bill of fare of
most civilized people is that of conformity to custom, surely not to
that of hygiene. That form of meat, therefore, which is pleasing to
the taste, and which has a tendency to reduce the quantity of flesh
consumed, is a step in the right direction of true food reform.</p>


<p class="p2">EFFECTS OF FEEDING POULTRY</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fattening poultry</div>

<p>The methods of fattening poultry by shutting them in small coops
or compartments, and feeding them upon soft mushy foods, is condemned
by some writers on the ground that it is unnatural and harmful to the
health of the fowls, and therefore the meat cannot be wholesome. In
truth, this process, if not carried too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
far, will produce a quality of meat less harmful than that of the
barnyard and ill-fed poultry. One of the greatest objections to the use
of animal food, as already explained, is the presence of the unexcreted
waste-products of animal metabolism. The flesh of fowls, fed and
fattened in coops, contains the smallest possible quantity of waste
or decomposition products, because of the limited amount of motion or
exercise they are permitted to undergo. For this reason, when poultry
is to be eaten, the whiter the meat the less objectionable it is as an
article of food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marketing poultry undrawn</div>

<p>The marketing of poultry in an undrawn condition (without the
removal of the internal organs), has been much condemned by the public,
and the legislatures of some states have passed laws against this
practise. This, however, is to some extent a misapplication of good
intentions. When poultry is to be killed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the market by those who thoroughly understand the business, the fowls
are left without food for a period of twenty-four hours. Since the
digestive processes of these small animals are very rapid, this results
in emptying the intestines of most of the fecal matter, which removes
the principal objection to the practise. On the other hand, if the
fowls are drawn at the time of killing, and several days elapse before
their consumption, bacteria gain access to the interior of the carcass
and cause very rapid decomposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Hanging" poultry</div>

<p>It is the practise in some oriental and European countries to "hang"
poultry for a few days before they are eaten. This process, as in the
case of ripened meats, is simply one of partial decay. The enzymotic
action taking place in the meat is arrested only by the process of cold
storage. Decomposition proceeds slowly until it reaches that point when
it is pronounced high-flavored and "ripened."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
This is very largely practised in this country at the present time.
It is a custom that is instinctively condemned by everyone from the
standpoint of both hygiene and aestheticism. The people should demand
and force Congress to pass a law labeling all cold storage meats
with the date of slaughter, and all canned meats with the date of
packing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slaughter of game as sport, a step backward</div>

<p>What is true of domestic poultry is also true of all wild game. The
amount of actual food contributed to the world by the slaughter of game
is exceedingly small. A similar quantity of domestic food could be
produced at one-tenth the cost of time and labor, without slaughtering
the wild creatures of our forests. The popularity of hunting as a
sport, and the idea that the flesh of all wild animals is a rare
and dainty article of diet, is merely an illustration of anthropoid
inheritance. It is a step backward toward savagery instead of forward
toward a higher civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2">EGGS</p>

<p>Eggs and milk occupy a unique place in the catalog of foods. The
purpose for which they were produced in nature throws much light upon
their value as food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Every form of life exists for itself alone</div>

<p>As will be learned from the lesson, "Evolution of Man," no living
creature exists for the sole benefit of other creatures, but because
once created, the inherent struggle of all living matter to survive
and to reproduce itself has evolved wonderful and various adaptations.
Every organic substance is primarily produced in nature for a specific
purpose in the life of its species. The lumber in our houses owes its
existence to the plant's struggle for sunlight, which made it necessary
for the tree to possess a strong storm-withstanding stem to hold aloft
its leaves above the shade of other foliage.</p>

<p>The leaves and the stems of grass are primarily an essential part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the life of the plant, and not food for animals. The greater part
of the human food of plant origin represents in nature the nutrient
material supplied by the parent plant for the early life of the
seedling. All grains, nuts, fruits and roots, and tubers are merely
modified forms of food material adapted to the rapid nourishment of the
young plant.</p>

<p>The starch and the oil of seeds, the sugar of fruit, and the lesser
quantities of nitrogen contained in all seeds, are in a more available
form for cell-nourishment than would be the original mature portions of
plant life.</p>

<p>Milk and eggs in the animal world occupy a position identical to
that of seeds and fruit in the plant world; that is, they are created
for the first nourishment of the offspring.</p>

<p>In the process of evolution, a fundamental distinction between birds
and mammals is in the manner in which the young are nourished. The egg
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
bird supplies sufficient nourishment to develop the young bird to a
point where it can exist upon the ordinary food of the adult bird.</p>

<p>The hen's egg must contain all food material necessary to form all
portions of the body of the chick, and to supply it for a time with
heat and energy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition of eggs</div>

<p>An average egg weighs two ounces; of this weight about 10 per cent
is shell, 30 per cent yolk, and the remainder white. The white of the
egg is composed of albumin and water. The yolk consists of globulin,
egg-fat, and lecithin; this latter substance contains a considerable
proportion of phosphorus, and is one of the essential contingents of
brain and nerves. The egg-shell contains 13 per cent protein, 10 per
cent fat, and one per cent ash.</p>

<p>The younger the animal, the more rapid is the growth of the animal
body compared with the amount of energy expended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Milk and eggs not a balanced adult diet</span>
For this reason the percentage of nitrogen in milk and in eggs is much
too great to form a balanced adult diet, and should be supplemented by
articles containing larger proportions of heat-producing materials,
preferably carbohydrates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eggs for emaciation and convalescents</div>

<p>The proteid material of eggs is in a form especially adapted to
the construction of new cells. For this reason it is one of the best
known foods for use in cases of emaciation, where new tissue is to be
added rapidly to the body. An egg contains about fourteen decigrams of
nitrogen. Ten eggs, therefore, would supply an ample amount of nitrogen
for the daily needs of the average body, were no nitrogen taken from
other sources. In feeding patients who are convalescing from fevers or
other wasting dis-eases, it is sometimes necessary to prescribe a diet
of from ten to twelve eggs daily for a limited time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>The consumption of five eggs a day, when we rely wholly upon this
article for animal proteids, is quite sufficient for one performing
ordinary labor, when supplemented by one succulent and one tuber
vegetable.</p>


<p class="p2">MILK</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk the best animal food</div>

<p>Milk and the various products made therefrom constitute one of the
most important groups of food in the modern bill of fare. Milk and eggs
are interdicted by some vegetarians, but aside from the sentimental
feeling against the taking of any food of animal origin, there are
no scientific reasons for such exclusion. Dairy products are free
from many of the objections assessed against the use of flesh, and
they supply a number of readily soluble, digestible, and assimilable
nutrients that, in many respects (curative and remedial feeding),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
excel anything that can be secured from the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of special feeding</div>

<p>The composition of cow's milk varies widely. Dairy cows, by long
domestication, breeding and feeding, have been brought to a high state
of specialization. Some breeds have been so trained, fed, and bred as
to produce large quantities of milk. Some Holsteins have been known to
produce one hundred pounds of milk per day each, which of course is
many times the quantity required for the nourishment of their young.
Some Jersey stock have been so bred, raised, and fed as to produce
large quantities of butter; in some cases the butter-fat of especially
fed Jerseys has been known to run as high as 8 or 10 per cent, whereas
the normal fat content of milk is not more than 3.5 or 4 per cent.</p>

<p>The average composition of mixed milk from many cows runs about as
follows: Water, 87 per cent; lactose or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
milk-sugar, 4.5 per cent; butter-fat, 3.5 per cent; ash, .7 per cent;
proteids, 3.3 per cent, of which about 2.5 per cent are casein, and .8
per cent albumin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of milk depends upon its nitrogenous content</div>

<p>The commercial value of milk is measured almost entirely by its
content of butter-fat. This is because the public knows practically
nothing about the food value, or the chemistry of milk, therefore its
value is estimated upon that which can be seen, and upon that which
tastes best. The chief value of milk as a food lies in the nitrogenous
element it contains. Fat can be secured from many other sources.</p>

<p>The nutritive elements of milk from various animals vary according
to the natural requirements of the young of various species.</p>

<p>Cow's milk contains too large a proportion of casein, and not enough
milk-sugar to meet the natural requirements of the human infant. This
subject, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
will be discussed at length in Lesson XVI on "Infant Feeding," Vol. V,
p. 1154.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coagulation of casein in milk</div>

<p>The casein in cow's milk is coagulated by the hydrochloric acid
of the stomach, which forms into lumps or curds, rather difficult to
digest. This can be overcome or counteracted in several ways. First, if
milk is allowed to sour or clabber, the casein is coagulated by nature,
which is really the first process of digestion. In this form it neither
burdens the digestion nor causes the supersecretion of hydrochloric
acid, which is likely to occur when sweet milk is too liberally used.
Second, the sipping and thorough insalivation of milk, by taking it
into the mouth with something that requires thorough mastication,
insures better digestion and assimilation, and less liability to
produce intestinal gas.</p>

<p>Milk will harmonize chemically with all non-acid fruits, cereals and
nuts. Milk is in chemical harmony with meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and eggs, but all of these articles being highly nitrogenous, when
taken at the same meal, the portions should be limited to the
minimum.</p>

<p>Milk should not be combined with acid fruits, especially those
of a highly acidulous character, such as lemons, limes, grapefruit,
pineapples, etc. (See Lesson VIII, Vol. II, p. 314.) Neither should
it be taken at the same meals with succulent plants, such as lettuce,
watercress, romaine, parsley, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk for sour or acid stomach</div>

<p>When the stomach has long been over-burdened with food, and made the
receptacle in which acid fermentation has taken place until the mucous
membrane has become irritated or probably ulcerated, there is no food
so acceptable as milk. For the common disorder of hyperchlorhydria,
which is a term used to describe a condition of chronic sour stomach or
supersecretion of hydrochloric acid, milk is one of Nature's best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
counteractive food nutrients. (See "Superacidity," Vol. II, p. 418.)</p>

<p>In cases of severe constipation or alimentary congestion, milk
should be given as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk diet for constipation</div>

<p>Omit breakfast. Begin about 9:30 taking an ordinary glassful of
fresh, cool milk every twenty or thirty minutes, until about one and
one-half quarts have been consumed. After two or three hours, repeat
the same process until about two quarts more have been taken. With each
quart of milk, from three to four heaping dessert-spoonfuls of clean,
wheat bran should be taken, in thin cream or rich milk. At noon and at
evening a few tablespoonfuls of coarse cereal (wheat or rye flakes),
might be eaten. They should be masticated thoroughly, and eaten with
nuts and a limited quantity of cream. Under this regimen I have known
the most severe cases of constipation to yield readily, and the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to make a gain in weight of half a pound daily for a period of from
twenty to thirty days. If the appetite should rebel against taking milk
in this quantity, the amount should be reduced, and a cupful of soaked
evaporated apricots taken at night just before retiring, and in the
morning, just after rising.</p>

<p>When milk is taken for the purpose of counteracting a congested
condition of the bowels, or an irritated condition of the mucous
membrane of the stomach, it should be combined with the fewest possible
things&mdash;one coarse cereal only will give the best results. A large
quantity of milk, three and one-half to four quarts taken daily, as
above directed, will act as a laxative, while a small quantity will
have a tendency toward constipation.</p>


<p class="p2">THE ADULTERATION OF MILK</p>

<p>The old method of adulterating milk with water has very largely gone out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of practise, owing to the surveillance of city authorities, and the
passing of laws that fix legal standards, which require milk to contain
a certain percentage of fats and total solids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil of milk preservatives</div>

<p>The chief form of criminal tampering with milk has been the use
of preservatives to prevent souring. Formaldehyde has been used very
extensively for this purpose. Formaldehyde is a poison, destructive to
all cell life, and has probably been the cause of more actual deaths
than any other form of food adulteration.</p>


<p class="p2">MILK PASTEURIZATION</p>

<p>Pasteurization, which takes its name from Pasteur, the French
bacteriologist, is merely a process of heating milk to about 170
degrees Fahrenheit for the purpose of destroying possible dis-ease
germs, and the bacteria that produce fermentation. In this process the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
milk is not allowed to come to a boil for the reason that boiled milk
is rather "dead" or distasteful, and would readily be detected by the
public. It is quite evident that any method of Pasteurization, which
would kill bacteria, would also cause coagulation of the protoplasm and
the albumin of the milk, and render it much less nutritious, and much
more difficult to digest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtue of naturally soured milk</div>

<p>If milk producers and dairymen understood the superior food and
remedial value of naturally soured milk, and would exert some effort
to educate the public in its use, they would soon establish a new and
profitable industry, and would give the dairy business of the whole
country a new commercial impetus. The souring of milk can be prevented
by cleanliness, which renders Pasteurizing unnecessary. At the time of
the Paris Exposition, a dairy farm in Illinois sent pure unpasteurized
milk to Paris, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
arrived in an unsoured condition. This was achieved by absolute
cleanliness, with the cows, dairy utensils, etc.</p>


<p class="p2">CHEESE</p>

<p>Cheese consists of the coagulated casein of milk, together with
the fat globules that may be mechanically retained. Cheese is made by
coagulating the milk with rennet, which has been extracted from the
stomach of a calf, the sugar of the milk being passed off in the whey,
and lost.</p>

<p>Schmier Käse or cottage cheese is formed by allowing the milk to
sour, and to coagulate by gradual warming. This cheese is usually made
from skimmed milk, hence contains practically no fat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The several processes of making cheese</div>

<p>The cheese of commerce is ripened in various ways. The process of
ripening is due to the action of enzyms present in the milk, or to
those formed by bacterial growth. Ripened cheese is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to be more easily digested than the unripened product. The best that
can be said of this process is that the ripening of cheese is perhaps
the least objectionable of all processes of decomposition taking
place in food proteids. The only benefit that can be claimed is one
of flavor, and, in matters of flavor, the appetite for Limburger, and
similar cheeses, is at least a cultivated taste that furnishes evidence
neither of merit nor of nutrition.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of cheese, the milk, sugar, and a part of the
albumin and fat are wasted, and as there are no advantages in taking
the milk in this changed form, there exists no scientific reason for
the use of cheese when fresh milk can be obtained.</p>


<p class="p2">BUTTER</p>

<p>Butter constitutes one of the most wholesome and palatable of all
animal fats, and is probably one of the most extensively used articles
of food of animal origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>When the pure butter-fat has been separated from the casein of milk
it can be kept sweet and wholesome for a length of time sufficient to
transport it, and to pass it through the various links in the chain of
commerce, so that it can reach the family table a long distance from
its source of production. This, in addition to man's instinctive relish
for dairy products, makes butter the most popular fat in the diet of
civilized man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh butter made in the home</div>

<p>In prescribing butter-fat, however, it is advisable to nominate
fresh, unsalted, or what is commonly termed "sweet" butter. It is also
advisable for the practitioner to suggest that this can be made daily,
merely by whipping either sweet or soured cream with an ordinary rotary
egg beater until the fat globules have separated from the whey.</p>

<p>Pure butter contains about 3,600 heat-calories to the pound, and
therefore constitutes one of the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and readily convertible of all winter foods.</p>

<p>If no other fat is used, about two ounces of butter each twenty-four
hours is sufficient to give the ordinary body, under a temperature
ranging from forty to sixty degrees above zero, the required amount of
heat.</p>


<p class="p2">OLEOMARGARIN</p>

<p>Oleomargarin is a general term that includes all manufactured
preparations of fats which imitate dairy butter.</p>

<p>Oleomargarin is manufactured by combining beef-fat with
cottonseed-oil until a product is formed which has a melting point
similar to that of butter. Lard is also used in some oleomargarin
products. This combination of fats is then churned with either cream
or milk and dairy butter is frequently added so as to give to the
artificial product the pleasant flavor or odor of dairy butter. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
much popular prejudice against the use of oleomargarin, but when made
under hygienic conditions, and by cleanly methods, it is practically as
digestible, and quite as wholesome as the dairy product.</p>
